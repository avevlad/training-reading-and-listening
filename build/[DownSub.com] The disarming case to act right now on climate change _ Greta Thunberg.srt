00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:16,308
When I was about eight years old,

3
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:20,550
I first heard about something
called climate change or global warming.

4
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:26,189
Apparently, that was something
humans have created by our way of living.

5
00:00:27,222 --> 00:00:30,839
I was told to turn off
the lights to save energy

6
00:00:31,088 --> 00:00:34,459
and to recycle paper to save resources.

7
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:39,079
I remember thinking
that it was very strange

8
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:43,019
that humans, who are
an animal species among others,

9
00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:47,198
could be capable of changing
the Earth's climate.

10
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,561
Because if we were,
and if it was really happening,

11
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:54,739
we wouldn't be talking
about anything else.

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,000
As soon as you'd turn on the TV,
everything would be about that.

13
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:03,541
Headlines, radio, newspapers,

14
00:01:03,849 --> 00:01:06,690
you would never read or hear
about anything else,

15
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,719
as if there was a world war going on.

16
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:13,360
But no one ever talked about it.

17
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,154
If burning fossil fuels was so bad
that it threatened our very existence,

18
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:23,278
how could we just continue like before?

19
00:01:24,263 --> 00:01:26,498
Why were there no restrictions?

20
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,320
Why wasn't it made illegal?

21
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:33,891
To me, that did not add up.

22
00:01:34,288 --> 00:01:36,297
It was too unreal.

23
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:40,978
So when I was 11, I became ill.

24
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,042
I fell into depression,

25
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,613
I stopped talking,

26
00:01:44,998 --> 00:01:46,487
and I stopped eating.

27
00:01:47,699 --> 00:01:51,488
In two months, I lost
about 10 kilos of weight.

28
00:01:52,889 --> 00:01:56,008
Later on, I was diagnosed
with Asperger syndrome,

29
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,289
OCD and selective mutism.

30
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:03,760
That basically means I only speak
when I think it's necessary -

31
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,670
now is one of those moments.

32
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,258
(Applause)

33
00:02:15,908 --> 00:02:18,290
For those of us who are on the spectrum,

34
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,857
almost everything is black or white.

35
00:02:21,564 --> 00:02:23,234
We aren't very good at lying,

36
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:26,598
and we usually don't enjoy
participating in this social game

37
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:29,153
that the rest of you seem so fond of.

38
00:02:29,153 --> 00:02:30,423
(Laughter)

39
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:33,751
I think in many ways
that we autistic are the normal ones,

40
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,368
and the rest of the people
are pretty strange,

41
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:37,561
(Laughter)

42
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:40,509
especially when it comes to
the sustainability crisis,

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,525
where everyone keeps saying
climate change is an existential threat

44
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:47,136
and the most important issue of all,

45
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,082
and yet they just carry on like before.

46
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:53,396
I don't understand that,

47
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:56,198
because if the emissions have to stop,

48
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:58,579
then we must stop the emissions.

49
00:02:59,194 --> 00:03:01,019
To me that is black or white.

50
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:04,460
There are no gray areas
when it comes to survival.

51
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,781
Either we go on
as a civilization or we don't.

52
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,939
We have to change.

53
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:15,950
Rich countries like Sweden
need to start reducing emissions

54
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,230
by at least 15 percent every year.

55
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:24,119
And that is so that we can stay
below a two-degree warming target.

56
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:28,273
Yet, as the IPCC
have recently demonstrated,

57
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,116
aiming instead for 1.5 degrees Celsius

58
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:35,302
would significantly
reduce the climate impacts.

59
00:03:35,928 --> 00:03:39,798
But we can only imagine
what that means for reducing emissions.

60
00:03:40,897 --> 00:03:43,600
You would think the media
and every one of our leaders

61
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:45,607
would be talking about nothing else,

62
00:03:45,897 --> 00:03:48,168
but they never even mention it.

63
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:50,733
Nor does anyone ever mention

64
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:53,859
the greenhouse gases
already locked in the system.

65
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,115
Nor that air pollution is hiding a warming

66
00:03:57,455 --> 00:04:00,128
so that when we stop burning fossil fuels,

67
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:02,617
we already have an extra level of warming

68
00:04:02,864 --> 00:04:07,314
perhaps as high as
0.5 to 1.1 degrees Celsius.

69
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:11,624
Furthermore does hardly
anyone speak about the fact

70
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:15,176
that we are in the midst
of the sixth mass extinction,

71
00:04:15,765 --> 00:04:20,686
with up to 200 species
going extinct every single day,

72
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:25,819
that the extinction rate today

73
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:29,619
is between 1,000 and 10,000 times higher

74
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:31,848
than what is seen as normal.

75
00:04:34,516 --> 00:04:39,879
Nor does hardly anyone ever speak about
the aspect of equity or climate justice,

76
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,227
clearly stated everywhere
in the Paris Agreement,

77
00:04:43,614 --> 00:04:47,849
which is absolutely necessary
to make it work on a global scale.

78
00:04:49,486 --> 00:04:51,342
That means that rich countries

79
00:04:51,342 --> 00:04:55,279
need to get down to zero emissions
within 6 to 12 years,

80
00:04:56,065 --> 00:04:58,337
with today's emission speed.

81
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,330
And that is so that people
in poorer countries

82
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,990
can have a chance to heighten
their standard of living

83
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,558
by building some of the infrastructure
that we have already built,

84
00:05:08,863 --> 00:05:11,911
such as roads, schools, hospitals,

85
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:14,960
clean drinking water,
electricity, and so on.

86
00:05:15,707 --> 00:05:20,299
Because how can we expect
countries like India or Nigeria

87
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:22,180
to care about the climate crisis

88
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:27,190
if we who already have everything
don't care even a second about it

89
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,048
or our actual commitments
to the Paris Agreement?

90
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:36,527
So, why are we not reducing our emissions?

91
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:40,909
Why are they in fact still increasing?

92
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,031
Are we knowingly causing
a mass extinction?

93
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:47,429
Are we evil?

94
00:05:49,118 --> 00:05:51,299
No, of course not.

95
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,329
People keep doing what they do

96
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:55,969
because the vast majority
doesn't have a clue

97
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:59,722
about the actual consequences
of our everyday life,

98
00:06:00,474 --> 00:06:03,449
and they don't know
that rapid change is required.

99
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,446
We all think we know,
and we all think everybody knows,

100
00:06:08,447 --> 00:06:10,020
but we don't.

101
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:12,339
Because how could we?

102
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,459
If there really was a crisis,

103
00:06:16,696 --> 00:06:19,583
and if this crisis was caused
by our emissions,

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,277
you would at least see some signs.

105
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:26,918
Not just flooded cities,
tens of thousands of dead people,

106
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:31,100
and whole nations leveled
to piles of torn down buildings.

107
00:06:31,904 --> 00:06:34,184
You would see some restrictions.

108
00:06:34,616 --> 00:06:36,300
But no.

109
00:06:36,774 --> 00:06:38,570
And no one talks about it.

110
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:46,032
There are no emergency meetings,
no headlines, no breaking news.

111
00:06:46,659 --> 00:06:49,645
No one is acting
as if we were in a crisis.

112
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:54,129
Even most climate scientists
or green politicians

113
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,130
keep on flying around the world,
eating meat and dairy.

114
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:08,057
If I live to be 100,
I will be alive in the year 2103.

115
00:07:09,738 --> 00:07:15,181
When you think about the future today,
you don't think beyond the year 2050.

116
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:20,992
By then, I will, in the best case,
not even have lived half of my life.

117
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,969
What happens next?

118
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:31,590
The year 2078, I will celebrate
my 75th birthday.

119
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:37,460
If I have children or grandchildren,
maybe they will spend that day with me.

120
00:07:38,682 --> 00:07:40,953
Maybe they will ask me about you,

121
00:07:41,384 --> 00:07:44,893
the people who were around, back in 2018.

122
00:07:46,786 --> 00:07:49,268
Maybe they will ask
why you didn't do anything

123
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,260
while there still was time to act.

124
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:58,268
What we do or don't do right now
will affect my entire life

125
00:07:58,268 --> 00:08:01,471
and the lives of my children
and grandchildren.

126
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,555
What we do or don't do right now,

127
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:08,681
me and my generation
can't undo in the future.

128
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:15,034
So when school
started in August of this year,

129
00:08:15,034 --> 00:08:17,594
I decided that this was enough.

130
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:22,015
I set myself down on the ground
outside the Swedish parliament.

131
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,928
I school striked for the climate.

132
00:08:26,677 --> 00:08:29,755
Some people say that I
should be in school instead.

133
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:33,929
Some people say that I should study
to become a climate scientist

134
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:37,224
so that I can "solve the climate crisis."

135
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:41,631
But the climate crisis
has already been solved.

136
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,368
We already have
all the facts and solutions.

137
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,818
All we have to do is
to wake up and change.

138
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,729
And why should I be studying for a future
that soon will be no more

139
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,799
when no one is doing anything
whatsoever to save that future?

140
00:08:59,859 --> 00:09:03,279
And what is the point of learning facts
in the school system

141
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,902
when the most important facts

142
00:09:05,902 --> 00:09:09,349
given by the finest science
of that same school system

143
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,629
clearly means nothing
to our politicians and our society.

144
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:18,648
Some people say that Sweden
is just a small country,

145
00:09:18,869 --> 00:09:21,499
and that it doesn't matter what we do,

146
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:26,179
but I think that if a few children
can get headlines all over the world

147
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:28,646
just by not coming to school
for a few weeks,

148
00:09:29,077 --> 00:09:32,108
imagine what we could all do
together if you wanted to.

149
00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:35,524
(Applause)

150
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,170
Now we're almost at the end of my talk,

151
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:46,380
and this is where people
usually start talking about hope,

152
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,412
solar panels, wind power,
circular economy, and so on,

153
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,418
but I'm not going to do that.

154
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:59,319
We've had 30 years of pep-talking
and selling positive ideas.

155
00:09:59,912 --> 00:10:02,199
And I'm sorry,
but it doesn't work.

156
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:04,517
Because if it would have,

157
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,779
the emissions would have gone down by now.

158
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,432
They haven't.

159
00:10:09,472 --> 00:10:11,920
And yes, we do need hope,

160
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,189
of course we do.

161
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:18,469
But the one thing we need
more than hope is action.

162
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,183
Once we start to act,
hope is everywhere.

163
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,960
So instead of looking for hope,

164
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,820
look for action.

165
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:32,519
Then, and only then, hope will come.

166
00:10:34,561 --> 00:10:41,045
Today, we use 100 million
barrels of oil every single day.

167
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,221
There are no politics to change that.

168
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:47,750
There are no rules
to keep that oil in the ground.

169
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:52,395
So we can't save the world
by playing by the rules,

170
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,570
because the rules have to be changed.

171
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:58,206
Everything needs to change --

172
00:10:58,676 --> 00:11:00,540
and it has to start today.

173
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:02,148
