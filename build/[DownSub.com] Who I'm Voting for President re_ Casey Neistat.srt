1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
I realize I'm a little bit late on this one,

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:07,200
Me and Hila just returned from a little vacation for our four year anniversary.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,200
Pound it.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,120
We had a great time, thank you.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,280
Let me explain;

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,660
Casey Neistat is a very popular YouTuber

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,340
who made a video a couple days ago

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,300
Casey: Hillary Clinton.

9
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,920
I will be voting

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,960
for Hillary Clinton.

11
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,940
Ethan: Casey endorsed Hillary with such

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,340
with such gusto, he basically fucked her in the ass.

13
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,880
And gave her a reach-around.

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,080
I mean he went

15
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,480
full service for her.

16
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,620
Which is fine.

17
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,880
And fra--frankly, I even respect it

18
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,600
a little bit, because I know it can be so divisive and difficult

19
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,340
to talk about politics.

20
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,140
So it's cool that he did that

21
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,240
and I respect that. But!

22
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,020
Towards the end of the video,

23
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,020
he gets into this whole thing about how

24
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,440
We're all mora--morally obligated

25
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,380
to vote for Hillary

26
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,560
and he even goes

27
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,040
as far as to

28
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,840
telling people to ask their favorite

29
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,220
creators on YouTube

30
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,080
to "get a spine,"

31
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,340
and "backbone,"

32
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,020
and make sure that we all vote...

33
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,120
for Hillary.

34
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:03,480
Casey: I want to end this by calling out all the big YouTubers.

35
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,860
Some I know, and some you viewers might know.

36
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,960
See, making videos like this... they're not popular,

37
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,440
they're not gonna get you subscribers,

38
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,260
they're not gonna boost your view counts.

39
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,460
But there is something much more valuable than subscribers or dollars --

40
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,920
And that's backbone.

41
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,260
Ethan: That kinda rubbed me the wrong way.

42
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,220
Before I do get into this, I just wanna say that

43
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,040
Casey is a wonderful guy.

44
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,420
He makes great videos, and he's one of the truly creative people on YouTube,

45
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,840
And I have nothing but admiration for him.

46
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,700
I can disagree with Casey without hating him.

47
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,040
And that's kinda the center of what I'm talking about here,

48
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,460
is that... we need to be able to discuss things without everybody losing their fucking mind,

49
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,740
and hating each other.

50
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,460
Now the way Casey talks about Donald Trump,

51
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,560
is that he--he almost implies that he's some kind of Adolf Hitler.

52
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,140
Casey: This is about a megalomaniac

53
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,340
who's driven by nothing but ego.

54
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,500
A man who cares exactly zero about the people of this country.

55
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,180
And if this guy gets elected,

56
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,460
and you stood back with your arms folded

57
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,780
and didn't speak out against him,

58
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,280
it makes you complicit [complacent].

59
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,320
It makes you partially responsible for handing him the reigns of power.

60
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,080
Ethan: And implies that if you don't vote for Hillary,

61
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,700
you're gonna be liable for whatever holocaust

62
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,300
he has up his sleeve.

63
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,120
And the way he talks about him,

64
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,320
he almost paints him as an inhuman demon,

65
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,420
okay?

66
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,840
Which is just so unproductive.

67
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,480
Hillary supporters think Donald is the Devil,

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,880
Hillary: You could put

69
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,420
half of Trump supporters into what

70
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,680
I call the "Basket of Deplorables."

71
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,960
The racist, sexist, homophobic,

72
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,040
xenophobic, Islamophobic - you name it.

73
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,060
Ethan: And Donald thinks that Hillary's the Devil.

74
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,060
Donald: ...but he made a deal with the Devil - she's the Devil.

75
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,480
...to see him sign on with the devil.

76
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,300
Ethan: They all perpetuate this notion.

77
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,720
And now, it's so confusing I don't understand

78
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,780
what to believe anymore.

79
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,400
If you put on CNN, Donald Trump is now a rapist, apparently,

80
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,680
with like a small gymnasium of women whose,

81
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,400
fuckin', pussies he's grabbed.

82
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,480
Donald, old recording: Grab 'em by the pussy.

83
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,000
Ethan: Hillary Clinton is married to a serial rapist,

84
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,000
you know,

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
i--it's... they're so - it's like,

86
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,200
"Why are we talking about how people are rapists?"

87
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,220
I mean these are just allegations, I don't know

88
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,400
if these people are rapists or not, but it's like...

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,280
Nobody is even talking about any real issues.

90
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,640
Everybody's just accusing each other of

91
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,540
actually being a rapist.

92
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,660
Like, has this gone too far?

93
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,280
Like, Trump shows up to the debate, the debates,

94
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,280
with like a small gymnasium of people

95
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,280
who Bill Clinton has apparently raped.

96
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,680
Maybe next year during the debates, half the people

97
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,280
could be Bill Clinton's rape victims,

98
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,540
and the other half Trump rape victims.

99
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,980
I just want all rape victims at next year's debates please.

100
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,740
No normal people at all.

101
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,240
Casey: So if your favorite YouTuber says things like,

102
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,520
"I don't like to talk politics on my channel," or

103
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,040
"I'm not going to reveal who I'm voting for,"

104
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,300
call them out.

105
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,520
Ethan: I think kinda the opposite of what he's saying.

106
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,080
Don't fucking listen to me.

107
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,700
Don't listen to Casey. We're just -- I'm just a YouTuber.

108
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,620
How does that qualify me to tell you who to vote for,

109
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,600
who to fucking elect as  President?

110
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,800
I literally go to the grocery store with two-hundred shirts on

111
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,320
and you're looking to me for advice on who to vote for President?

112
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,060
There have got to be better people out here to advise you on that.

113
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,500
And here's the worst part: if you're someone who

114
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
generally is like, "Yeah, I don't like either of them,

115
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,520
neither of them really represent who I am as a person,

116
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,920
and I don't like either of them,"

117
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,380
if you're like, "I'm not gonna vote for them."

118
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,600
Each side says to you,

119
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,300
"Oh, well you're a f-- you not voting is basically

120
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,040
voting for my - for the other guy."

121
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,380
Or, "You not voting is basically voting for the other guy."

122
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,540
And here's Casey himself saying, "If you don't vote for Hillary,

123
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,180
you're responsible for the Holocaust, part two."

124
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,060
It's like, tone it down, dawg! Get off your fucking white horse.

125
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,840
You just make fucking vlogs!

126
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,540
You just fly drones around New York City!

127
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,900
Let's all tone it fucking down.

128
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,980
The climate is so toxic right now on both sides, that

129
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:08,940
you can't even be in the middle, because they'll call -- they'll yell at you and tell you,

130
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,140
you are the Devil for not choosing one of 'em.

131
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,220
And God forbid you try to choose a third-party guy.

132
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,980
A vote for the third-party guy,

133
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,980
which is basically a vote against the system,

134
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,720
you ask one of them, "That's a vote for Hillary!"

135
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,980
"That's a vote for Trump!"

136
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:27,020
In short, guys, don't let people bully you

137
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,380
into voting one way or the other with their extreme, hateful shit.

138
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,620
It's not fair that you get guilted and shamed into voting one way or another,

139
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,240
and it's really fucked up that you get ostracized for

140
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,460
being in the middle.

141
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,720
For trying to be a sane, rational person, who's like

142
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,820
"Well, I haven't made up my mind, they're both kinda

143
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:49,120
insane, I don't, like..." You're the Devil now.

144
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,480
Don't let people bully you and make you feel like shit because you want to be in the middle.

145
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,620
More people should be in the middle.

146
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,740
Most people should be in the middle.

147
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,700
But it's like this.

148
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,040
There's not two teams, we're all American.

149
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,840
And don't let people tell you that voting for a third party is a wasted vote -

150
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,280
because voting for a third party is a vote against the system itself.

151
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,120
We need more options,

152
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,460
okay,

153
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,040
it's just not enough.

154
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,460
Everyone just needs to fucking chill out, and have a sodie pop.

155
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,220
So, in short, who am I voting for?

156
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,880
Only one option.

157
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,180
Hugh Mungus for President. *Patriotic music*

158
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,660
Angry Woman: Hugh Mungus what?

159
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,680
Hugh Mungus: Hugh Mungus.

160
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,380
So I urge everybody now following me who believes in me

161
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,440
write in "Hugh Mungus" for President of the United States, 2016

162
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,720
Angry Woman: Is that sexual harassment?

163
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,600
Hugh Mungus: No, it's Hugh Mungus.

164
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,340
Ethan: Make Hugh Mungus great again.

165
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,480
God bless America

166
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,700
*Chair falling* *Ethan Klein's cough™ - grunt*

167
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,480
We're all so fucked, dude.

168
00:06:51,080 --> 00:00:00,000
We are all so fucked.
