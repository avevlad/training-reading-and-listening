1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,417
(calm music)

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,920
- It's hard to believe that
it's been almost 10 years

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:08,890
since Samsung released the
first Galaxy S smartphone,

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,090
but here we are with the Galaxy S10,

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,920
and it's easily the best Galaxy S yet.

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,500
But if the first few Galaxy phones

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,200
were close copies of the iPhone,

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,442
enough so much that Apple
actually sued Samsung and won,

9
00:00:20,442 --> 00:00:23,440
the Galaxy S10 shows that
Samsung has evolved its flagship

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,870
to offer almost everything
the iPhone doesn't.

11
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,280
It's got a headphone
jack, expandable storage,

12
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,070
fingerprint scanner, and almost no notch.

13
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,880
You could practically
call it the anti-iPhone.

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,630
But it does share some
things with the iPhone,

15
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,710
like the fact that it's expensive.

16
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,112
The S10 starts at $899, the
S10 Plus that I have here

17
00:00:41,112 --> 00:00:46,112
starts at $999 and goes all
the way up to 1600 bucks.

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,200
That's like three basic model OnePlus 6Ts.

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,270
This may be the best Galaxy S phone ever,

20
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,780
but it's also far and
away the most expensive

21
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,781
Galaxy S phone ever.

22
00:00:56,781 --> 00:00:59,240
(upbeat music)

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,920
The S10's hardware is very nice.

24
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,620
It's exactly what you'd expect for a phone

25
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,950
that costs this much.

26
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,610
It's an evolution of what Samsung started

27
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,590
four years ago with the Galaxy S6.

28
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,600
Has aluminum sides with a polished finish,

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,360
and front and rear glass.

30
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,010
Now, on the S10 and the S10 Plus,

31
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,630
the glass curves into the frame,

32
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,210
which makes it feel great in your hand

33
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,750
and more comfortable to hold,

34
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,250
even though these are really big phones.

35
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,733
Now, on that point, the
S10 Plus is definitely

36
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:25,860
not a one hand phone, not for me at least.

37
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,840
If I were to purchase it,
I'd probably put a case,

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,970
and maybe even one of those
PopSockets on the back

39
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,010
to make it easier to hold and use.

40
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,350
If you do want something smaller,

41
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,130
Samsung has a regular
S10, and then the S10e

42
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,840
which we're going to
cover in a separate video,

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,970
so stay tuned for that.

44
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,100
Now, like I said before,
there's a headphone jack

45
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,220
down at the bottom,
Samsung actually includes

46
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,480
some pretty nice wired headphones
that plug right into it.

47
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,200
Plus, loud stereo speakers for

48
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,860
when you're not wearing headphones.

49
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,410
Like the last few Galaxy S models,

50
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,680
the S10 is water resistant,

51
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,820
has fast wired and wireless charging,

52
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,320
and you can expand the
storage with a microSD card,

53
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,710
though I think most people
will probably be pretty happy

54
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,610
with the 128 gigs it comes
with in the base model.

55
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,520
You can even use the S10 to
wirelessly charge another device

56
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,900
like Samsung's new Galaxy Bud headphones,

57
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,380
or Galaxy Watch Active smartwatch,

58
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,450
but I really have found much use for that

59
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,970
beyond just showing it off.

60
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,130
The big annoying thing
with the S10's hardware

61
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,080
is the same as it has been for
the last few Samsung phones.

62
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,720
There's a hardware button
dedicated to launching Bixby.

63
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,909
Now fortunately, Samsung
is going to let you finally

64
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:26,130
reprogram it to something more useful,

65
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,410
like say maybe launching the camera.

66
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,730
But sadly, you can't use to
launch the Google Assistant.

67
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,580
And this is all I'm
going to say about Bixby,

68
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,750
because it's still bad,

69
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,960
and you should still avoid it if possible.

70
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,980
Inside, the S10 is the
first phone I've used

71
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,905
with the Snapdragon 855 processor,

72
00:02:40,905 --> 00:02:43,020
and performance is really fast.

73
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,420
It's smooth and responsive,

74
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,550
and there's no real lag anywhere.

75
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,590
I don't think it's as blisteringly
fast as a OnePlus phone,

76
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,920
but I've got no real
performance complaints here.

77
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,850
I also don't have any complaints
with the battery life.

78
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,290
I don't think the S10 Plus
is breaking any records,

79
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,190
but it's reliable enough

80
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,030
that I just don't have to worry about it.

81
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,770
I've been able to get
two days between charges

82
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,650
with light usage, and have no real trouble

83
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,090
making it a full day with heavy usage.

84
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,180
But it is a big phone, with a big battery,

85
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,700
so this is the kind of battery
life that I kind of expect

86
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,533
at this point.

87
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,140
(upbeat music)

88
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,700
The S10 Plus's display
does not disappoint.

89
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,360
It's a 6.4 inch HDR10+ OLED screen,

90
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,770
that gets super bright, and
has rich, vibrant colors

91
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,370
and great viewing angles.

92
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,560
The screen stretches all the way

93
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,080
to the top and bottom of the phone,

94
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,680
with just the tiniest
of borders around it.

95
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,150
Now, Samsung seems to have toned down its

96
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,220
super aggressive saturation this year,

97
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,490
so the normal video
mode, which is what I use

98
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,410
this screen in, looks really pleasing,

99
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,640
and not eye searing, like it used to.

100
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,460
But, that isn't particularly
new or exciting.

101
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,040
What is exciting is what's
embedded in this display.

102
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,390
As you probably already
noticed, the S10 doesn't have

103
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,640
a notch cut out for its
front facing camera.

104
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,690
Instead, it has this
weird hole punch shape

105
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,170
off to the right side.

106
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,960
On the S10 Plus, that houses two cameras,

107
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,400
the main camera, and second
one for depth effects

108
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,340
and portrait mode.

109
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,010
Is this any better than a notch

110
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,030
which would just be in
the middle of the screen

111
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,750
instead of off to the side?

112
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,060
I don't really think so.

113
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,010
In fact, I would rather have a notch

114
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,260
since at least that has some symmetry.

115
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,560
This hole punch design pushes

116
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,910
the battery and network
indicators off to the left,

117
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,790
and it just looks weird when
I'm looking at it all day long.

118
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,230
You can choose to hide
the front cameras entirely

119
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,800
with a uniform black bar across the top,

120
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,110
but that's just like adding
a giant bezel to the top,

121
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,420
and looks even worse.

122
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,900
Sometimes, that black bar shows up

123
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,210
depending on which app you're using.

124
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,210
Here's what it looks like when I

125
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,390
read an article in Pocket, for example.

126
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,810
None of this is the end of the world,

127
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,110
the S10's display still looks really nice,

128
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,170
and it's probably one of the best

129
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,290
actual panels you can get on a phone.

130
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,820
I'd just rather have
a notch in the middle,

131
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,290
but I'm sure you'll let me know

132
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,820
in the comments if you disagree.

133
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,180
The other thing that's
embedded in the screen

134
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,854
is the new fingerprint
scanner which has been moved

135
00:04:44,854 --> 00:04:47,610
from the back of the
phone up to the front.

136
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,850
The scanner's ultrasonic,
which is a little different

137
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,990
from the optical ones we've seen

138
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,020
on OnePlus and other phones.

139
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,020
That's supposed to make
it a bit more reliable

140
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,550
and harder to spoof.

141
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,810
It can be hard to find, but
it's about half an inch up

142
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,760
from the bottom, and if
you're using a lock screen

143
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,210
it'll actually show you
where to place your finger.

144
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,450
But it's not a big area,
and if you're not deliberate

145
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,390
with your finger placement,
it can be easy to miss.

146
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,480
And this scanner is definitely not as fast

147
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,690
as traditional capacitive
ones, and I often have to try

148
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,800
a couple of times before it will unlock.

149
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,740
I'd just rather have a Face ID system

150
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,200
that requires less work to use,

151
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,480
or at the very least, and old
school fingerprint scanner

152
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,110
on the back of the phone.

153
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:24,560
Now, the S10 does have a
face unlocking feature,

154
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,870
but you should know that it's just

155
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,390
using the camera to look for your image.

156
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,200
There's no 3D mapping,
or advanced scanning.

157
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,350
So it's not as secure as
the fingerprint scanner,

158
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,900
or Apple's Face ID.

159
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,050
I was actually able to unlock
it with a video of my face

160
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,423
played on another phone, so there you go.

161
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,930
(hip hop music)

162
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,310
Here's the main takeaway
you should know about

163
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,320
the S10's camera.

164
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,920
It is perhaps the most versatile

165
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,750
of any of the mainstream phones.

166
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,820
That's because the S10 has
three cameras on the back,

167
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,160
which give you different perspectives

168
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,800
at the click of a button.

169
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,080
There's a standard camera,
a telephoto camera,

170
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,610
and then a brand new ultra-wide camera.

171
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,380
It's like having a whole
camera bag full of lenses

172
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,370
built right into the back of your phone,

173
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,920
and it lets you capture perspectives,

174
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,830
especially that super wide one that you

175
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,090
just can't get with an iPhone or a Pixel.

176
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,420
One weird thing to note
about this, though?

177
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,430
The S10's portrait mode
uses the main camera

178
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,840
instead of the telephoto,
so your portrait shots

179
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,140
are going to come out pretty wide,

180
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,810
maybe wider than you expect.

181
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,500
It's kind of like how the iPhone XR works,

182
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,300
as opposed to the XS.

183
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,490
Now, aside from the new lens,

184
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,610
the camera performance
really hasn't changed much

185
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,480
from last year's S9 Plus.

186
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,050
The S10's camera is still very good,

187
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,730
with fast focusing, fast launching,

188
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,020
and generally great performance
in most lighting situations.

189
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,853
But if you didn't like the way

190
00:06:32,853 --> 00:06:34,200
the photos from the S9 looked,

191
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,760
you probably aren't going
to be swayed by the S10.

192
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,180
Personally, I find it
overexposes more than I prefer,

193
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,250
which does make for a brighter image,

194
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,580
but it sometimes causes things like

195
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,780
skin tones to look unnatural.

196
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,020
It also has a warmer look than the iPhone,

197
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,660
and especially the Pixel,
which can make images look

198
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,740
a bit more yellow than I like.

199
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,290
Now, for HDR, Samsung
basically splits the difference

200
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,740
between the iPhone and the Pixel.

201
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,870
It's not as moody as Google's phone,

202
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,790
but it doesn't pull up shadows
as much as Apple's does.

203
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,094
And that's partly because
it doesn't really need to,

204
00:07:03,094 --> 00:07:04,630
because it's already overexposing the shot

205
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,880
more than Apple would.

206
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,290
Samsung has added some new
software tricks to the camera.

207
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,220
It has a feature that will

208
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,480
help you compose your shots better,

209
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,480
which is kinda cool, because
it can help you avoid

210
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,200
crooked lines in your photos.

211
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,730
But, I didn't end up
using it all that much.

212
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,150
It also does have a night mode,

213
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,270
but unlike the Pixel,
you can't just turn it on

214
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,400
whenever you want.

215
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,050
You need to be in a really dark area,

216
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,980
less than one lux of light,

217
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,110
and be using the scene optimizer
mode for it to trigger,

218
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,410
and even if you do all that,

219
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,700
it still doesn't work as well as

220
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,560
Google's Night Sight anyways

221
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,770
Over on the video side though,

222
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,740
the S10 is way more
impressive than the Pixel

223
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,110
and even gives the iPhone
a run for its money.

224
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,210
You can shoot in up to
4K, 60 frames per second

225
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,360
with the main camera, or 4K, 30 FPS

226
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,190
with the ultra-wide, or the telephoto.

227
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:46,430
There's a new super steady
stabilization feature

228
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,230
that makes really smooth footage,

229
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,210
but just know that will lock you to 1080p

230
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,220
and the main camera when you turn it on.

231
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,170
Finally, the stereo sound
that's recorded by the dual mics

232
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,983
on the S10 is actually
quite good, and better than

233
00:07:57,983 --> 00:08:01,300
what I'm used to hearing from
most other Android phones.

234
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,680
For the front camera, the
new 10 megapixel sensor

235
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,380
with autofocus produces
really sharp images,

236
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,440
and there's even a software button

237
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,850
to get a little bit wider of a view

238
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,510
if you're shooting a group selfie.

239
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,360
Now, Samsung does do some pretty
aggressive noise reduction

240
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,560
and skin smoothing,
especially in low light,

241
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,750
but thankfully, the beauty modes

242
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,260
are all turned off by default.

243
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,320
Then there's the portrait
mode on the S10 Plus,

244
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,170
it's pretty decent, but it's not perfect,

245
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,860
just like any other
portrait mode you can get

246
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,290
on any other phone, and
there's a couple of new effects

247
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,020
that you'll probably use once,
and then never touch again,

248
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,170
kinda like Apple's
portrait lighting stuff.

249
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,159
For many years, Samsung phones have always

250
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,359
had super tempting
hardware that was let down

251
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,980
by lousy software.

252
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,230
I'm happy to say that's
not the case with the S10.

253
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,470
Its software isn't perfect,

254
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,400
and I definitely have some complaints,

255
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,420
but overall, it looks nice, makes sense,

256
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,430
and is mostly easy to use.

257
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,700
Samsung's calling this software One UI,

258
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,720
and it's also now available
on last year's S9 phones,

259
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,910
which my colleague Dieter
just did a video about,

260
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,367
so you should go check that out,

261
00:08:57,367 --> 00:08:59,870
but the gist is Samsung
has finally built software

262
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,870
that works with its big phones.

263
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,580
It has designed much
of the user experience

264
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,630
to make it easier to use
these giant screened phones

265
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,150
by putting a lot of the important
stuff down by your thumb,

266
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,390
so you don't have to reach
to the top to get it.

267
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,090
But I'd still like to
see more improvements.

268
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,480
I ended up using the
default three button nav bar

269
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,180
instead of Samsung's gestures,

270
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,720
because they're just kind of confusing.

271
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,790
There're also still a
bunch of duplicate apps,

272
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,890
like two email apps, two app stores,

273
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,930
two browsers, et cetera, and so on.

274
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,920
I wish Samsung would just
let me choose which ones

275
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,810
to install when I'm setting up the phone.

276
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,600
Plus, I've been using an unlocked model,

277
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,080
so you can expect carriers
to make this even worse

278
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,740
with their own apps.

279
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,860
Is anyone ready for VZ Messenger?

280
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,120
And the main nagging question
with Samsung software

281
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,550
is how long is it going
to take to get updates?

282
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,110
Google's going to release Android Q

283
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,670
sometime later this year.

284
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,920
And you'll probably have
to wait another half a year

285
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,340
or more before it arrives on the S10,

286
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,590
if last year's schedule
is anything to go by.

287
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:57,030
(drum music)

288
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,890
It's easy to dismiss the S10
as just another Galaxy phone

289
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,130
without anything really
new or groundbreaking,

290
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,440
and you'd really not be that wrong.

291
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,970
After all, Samsung itself is going to

292
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,360
release a crazy folding phone

293
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,770
in like, two months, and
the S10 is just another

294
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,070
slab smartphone like we've had for years.

295
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,800
But this is the Android phone
that more people will buy

296
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,360
than any other, and it provides
as strong an alternative

297
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,370
to the iPhone as you can find.

298
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,060
It really comes down
to personal preference.

299
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,430
Are you so married to iOS and iMessage

300
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,700
that you'll never leave?

301
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,950
Or are you looking for something

302
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,000
that has features that you
just can't get on the iPhone?

303
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,840
If you're the latter, well
then the S10 is here for you.

304
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,000
Likewise, if you're debating
between the S10 and a Pixel,

305
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,330
the question is how important
are software updates

306
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,230
and night photography to you?

307
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,480
If those things aren't
very high on your list,

308
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,630
the S10 is better than
a Pixel in virtually

309
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:46,420
every other respect, and
finally, if you're wondering

310
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,710
whether or not the S10
Plus is worth nearly

311
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,870
double the cost of a OnePlus 6T,

312
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,650
your money will go
towards a better display,

313
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,490
better speakers, waterproofing,
wireless charging,

314
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,960
and a much better camera.

315
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,000
That might be enough
stuff to make it worth it,

316
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,560
provided you actually care
about all of those things.

317
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,050
It's been 10 years since
the first Galaxy S phone,

318
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,030
and it's clear that Samsung
has come a long way.

319
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:09,102
Now, I'm curious to
see, where's it gonna go

320
00:11:09,102 --> 00:11:11,430
in the next 10 years?

321
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,410
Hey, thanks for watching.

322
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,550
