1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,020
Sometimes, YouTube just spreads it's cheeks so wide

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,620
It's hard not to grab a bucket of mayonnaise, and go in for a full thrust

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,260
And today, I've been given that opportunity

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,660
You guys all know about the Ad-pocalypse by now

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:18,160
and in the wake of that there's been a huge string of demonetizations,

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,340
of people making way less money,

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,480
and overall just a lot of creators and YouTubers losing a lot of their livelihood,

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,520
and just getting dinged left and right.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,480
With this piss colored demonetization sign

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,900
they show up on your videos, and that's what it feels like.

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,400
Pissed.

12
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,880
You got pissed on your soul,

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,720
And now you're pissed because most of the time it just doesn't make any sense

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,730
and that's fine because all of us YouTubers are dealing with this shit and

15
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,819
You know what, that's just the world we're living in now.

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,189
We've all more or less accepted it

17
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,800
But when you see shit like what I'm about to show you, it makes that yellow piss sign a little bit harder to swallow.

18
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,649
That's a golden shower my friends

19
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,538
And we don't all like bathing in piss. Casey Neistat made a video about the Las Vegas shooting

20
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:07,228
He said, "literally a video about charity where I state all Adsense is going to that charity YouTube says not suitable for advertisers"

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,979
"We love what you're doing to help

22
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:15,059
But no matter the intent our policy is to not run ads on videos about tragedies"

23
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,869
It's their policy, and it doesn't matter what's your intent.

24
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:24,508
Let's hop on over to Jimmy Kimmel who did, in my opinion have a very powerful monologue on his show

25
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:27,390
Jimmy Kimmel on the mass shooting in Las Vegas. I'm a huge fan

26
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,100
Jimmy Kimmel and I agree with him actually

27
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,739
But I'm also a big fan of free speech. YouTube if it's your policy to not run ads on videos about

28
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:39,749
tragedies no matter the intent, then how do you explain this? "Jimmy Kimmel on Mass Shooting in Las Vegas"

29
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,409
GMC ad. Here's an ad for the new Blade Runner movie.

30
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,060
And it's number one on trending! Okay, yesterday IDubbbz made a video

31
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,100
that got 10 million views in the first day

32
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,799
didn't get a blip on trending. So they not only made the conscious decision to put ads on this video in

33
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,969
contradiction of their own statement, they've also decided to trend it number one

34
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:05,429
This is called selective enforcement. When you have rules that are so general that you can

35
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:12,719
prosecute pretty much anyone you want, when you use that broadness to enforce a certain ideology, that censorship,

36
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,899
Now as much as I love Jimmy Kimmel and agree with him,

37
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:21,269
Would YouTube put ads and promote somebody from the,

38
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,150
conflicting side from the right with an opposing view?

39
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,799
I don't think so

40
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:29,489
I don't at all, and while I disagree with them, like I said

41
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:33,718
I'm more proponent of free speech and what they're doing is-is clearly picking a side

42
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:37,079
And they're paying them too. Like ABC needs that Adsense revenue?

43
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,989
ABC Jimmy Kimmel needs that 6 million Adsense revenue? Meanwhile creators are getting pissed on?

44
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,619
literally taking golden showers on the daily? I mean Christ,

45
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,859
I'll take some urine on the face in the heat of the moment, but not on as a daily occurrence

46
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:56,759
That's too much for me, and-and I assume for most youtubers as well. Even after Philly D tweeted this and it got

47
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,049
350,000 likes, they never responded to the criticism.

48
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,449
In fact, they doubled down. This video has more ads than I have seen in the past month since this ad pocalypse

49
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:11,999
happened. Just out of curiosity, I went and checked this morning to see if ads were still on the video in

50
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:20,459
response to Philly D's criticism. Let's have a look, Royal Caribbean, Wells Fargo, University of Phoenix, Geo storm- that movie looks awful

51
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,619
I'm not gonna watch that one. Just to give my opinion.

52
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,879
It's not relevant to this to this video, but seriously this looks like horseshit.

53
00:03:27,069 --> 00:03:32,008
So their response was not only to ignore the criticism, not enforce their own rules,

54
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:36,359
But to double down and put what seemed like even more ads on the video

55
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:38,728
And here's the thing I think they should have ads

56
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:42,929
I think we should all have ads, this whole thing, this outrage is ridiculous

57
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:49,109
And you know how I know that? I was watching CNN when the shooting was happening. My parents live in Vegas,

58
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:50,099
They heard about it

59
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:56,399
They told me, I immediately turned on CNN to see what was going on this was an active, live, shooting

60
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,239
There was a reporter, live on the scene, giving updates. This is a screenshot

61
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,209
I took off my own television. These guys were running ads, 5 minute long ads,

62
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:12,899
every 5 minutes, when they knew people were watching. Glued to the TV, looking for live updates. This one

63
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:20,340
I pictured here: 3 out of 7 ads. Here's the ironic touch, that makes you adjust love that golden shower "Brought to you by:

64
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:22,539
Coca-Cola!

65
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:24,250
Dr. Pepper!

66
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,660
Pepsi!" You know at first, I was just angry at CNN for

67
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,609
monetizing this tragedy, this live tragedy right? I'm glued to the TV,

68
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:38,550
I'm looking for updates and these sick fucks are basically just pulling the money lever because that- ratings are so high

69
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,690
But then when I'm think about it after a couple hours. I'm like, hold on a fucking second.

70
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,580
These are the same brands that boycotted YouTube! Coca-Cola,

71
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,070
Dr. Pepper, Pepsi! Dude, these are the same guys that pulled their ads out of YouTube for being

72
00:04:53,530 --> 00:05:00,809
"inappropriate!" That caused these new guidelines that you can't put ads on tragedies unless you're, you know, someone that we approve

73
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:08,400
like Jimmy Kimmel. Nobody's sincere. These brands don't give a shit about monetizing tragedy. They've been doing it for decades on CNN.

74
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,970
It's just about control and politics and money. That's it.

75
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:17,700
I saw all these brands that boycotted YouTube, and I'm like oh my god.

76
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,639
So this is confirmed just a total sham. I truly don't think that you'll see any more,

77
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,220
"edgy," interesting, channels coming up in a big way on YouTube anymore. You won't see it.

78
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,440
All you ever gonna see on YouTube anymore is Jake Paul, Logan Paul. You're gonna get more Dude Perfect.

79
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,829
There's no soul left. There's no backbone left.

80
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,979
It's just goo and piss.

81
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:46,590
And I'll tell you what else, if you want more proof that we are truly living in the darkest timeline; that is Logan Paul.

82
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,989
On a Tonight Show, he preceded Ryan Gosling.

83
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,489
Advertisers are lining up to put their ads on this video.

84
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,999
How is this not trending on all 20 spots? This should be. If I could just get them both dabbing.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,339
I think that we could get number one trending with this video. And with that being said, I've been getting a lot of

86
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,380
steamy yellow piss in my face on a regular basis, that I'm starting to like it. So Hila,

87
00:06:13,380 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope you're hydrated because I'm gonna need you to take a piss on my face. Thanks YouTube for my new fetish. Bye.
