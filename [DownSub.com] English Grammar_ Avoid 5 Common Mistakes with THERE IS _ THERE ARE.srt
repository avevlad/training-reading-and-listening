1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,320
This is a living room. There is a couch. There is a fireplace.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,100
There are windows. There are pillows.

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,620
When you were first learning English, you probably made sentences like these

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,780
to talk about things you see or things that exist.

5
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,740
It seems like an easy topic, right?

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:34,860
But as you know, simple things become a bit more complicated as you progress in your studies.

7
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:43,620
In this lesson, let's make sure you're avoiding common mistakes with There is/There are.

8
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,480
[title]

9
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,980
Don't choose the wrong verb form. Use subject-verb agreement.

10
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,380
We use THERE plus a form of BE to talk about things that exist.

11
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,260
The focus is on the noun that follows the verb BE.

12
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,860
We use a singular verb before a singular noun.

13
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:23,720
For example, this is a living room. There is a couch. There is a fireplace.

14
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,740
We use a plural verb before a plural noun.

15
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,740
There are windows. There are pillows.

16
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,020
If you have an uncountable noun, remember to use a singular verb.

17
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:44,960
There is enough room here for a piano. Usually there is plenty of sunlight.

18
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:52,340
Some words can create confusion. "Variety" is a good example.

19
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:57,520
Even native speakers get confused and wonder if we should write

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:06,080
"There is a wide variety of products." OR "There are a wide variety of products."

21
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,560
Most dictionaries list "variety" (in "a wide variety") as a singular noun,

22
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:17,100
which leads us to the conclusion that we should say "There is a wide variety of products."

23
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,000
But here's another solution: Find an alternative. How about this?

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,040
The store has a wide variety. They sell many different products.

25
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,340
Don't break the rules at the wrong time.

26
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:47,880
You can get away with breaking subject-verb agreement rules, but only in very informal English, especially spoken English.

27
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,320
I just said the verb has to agree with the noun that follows.

28
00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:02,020
But in American English, it's become somewhat acceptable to use the contraction "There's" before a plural noun.

29
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:06,040
This is my purse, and it's really heavy.

30
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,560
There's probably a lot of things in here that I don't need.

31
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,680
Now that's grammatically incorrect.

32
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,160
I should say, "There are a lot of things that I probably don't need."

33
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,080
"Things" - that's a plural noun.

34
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,280
But in fast informal English, I can say, "There's a lot of things..."

35
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,060
There's a lot of things I probably don't need in here.

36
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:32,000
And my listeners won't mind.

37
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:41,680
But if you're writing formal email or making a business presentation, I don't recommend following this pattern.

38
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,820
Follow the rules for subject-verb agreement in more formal situations.

39
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:55,440
Use a singular verb before a series of singular nouns.

40
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,960
Here's an example. I'll tell you about the things in this living room.

41
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,600
There's a couch a rug, a bookcase, and a piano.

42
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:15,440
Although I listed more than one thing, the item that immediately followed the verb BE was a singular noun: a couch.

43
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,740
It sounds more natural to use a singular verb.

44
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,779
There is a couch.

45
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:28,640
It's understood that I could repeat "there is" before each item in the list, but I say it only once.

46
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,460
There is a couch, a rug, a bookcase, and a piano.

47
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:40,060
Use the word "any" correctly with There is/There are.

48
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:44,460
We use "any" in questions and in negative statements.

49
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,680
To ask whether something exists, you don't need "any."

50
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,680
For example, I could ask, "Is there a post office nearby?"

51
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:03,460
If you don't care about specific details and you only want a yes-no answer, then you can use "any."

52
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:09,200
For example: Is there any electrician who charges less than $100 an hour?

53
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,260
I want to know: Is there one? Anyone?

54
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,000
Name anyone for me who charges less than $100 an hour.

55
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,360
In a negative statement, I use "any" to express what I have nothing of.

56
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,260
For example, there aren't any flowers in this room.

57
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,960
There isn't any place to take a long nap.

58
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,100
In negative statements, we use "any" with "not."

59
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:44,460
For emphasis, we could simply use "no." As in, there's no place like home.

60
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,600
As a writer, don't overuse There is/There are -

61
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,980
because then you're writing will sound wordy.

62
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,640
Let's take a moment to consider a difference between speaking and writing.

63
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,320
We might use "there is/there are" quite a lot in conversation

64
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:12,360
not only to talk about what exists, but also to recall information or facts.

65
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,940
For example, my husband might complain that we can't go out to dinner because we don't have a babysitter.

66
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:24,240
But then I can mention a possibility that he might have forgotten.

67
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,280
And I want him to recall this fact.

68
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,900
I could say, "Well, there's our neighbor. Couldn't we ask her?"

69
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,060
I'm presenting this possibility to consider.

70
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,760
Now let's switch to a written context.

71
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:46,640
Take a look and tell me if you like how this email sounds.

72
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,000
[reads]

73
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,360
This could be less wordy, couldn't it?

74
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,760
Let's compare this version to another.

75
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,140
[reads]

76
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,800
Did you note the changes?

77
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,440
Do you see how I reduced the number of times I used "There is/There are"?

78
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,460
Okay. How well have you been listening?

79
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,520
Let's do a quick check.

80
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,540
Choose the correct verb.

81
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,360
Answers.

82
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,200
1. There is a bunch of stuff in the hallway.

83
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,179
"Stuff" is an uncountable noun.

84
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:38,019
There is stuff. How much stuff? A lot of stuff. A bunch of stuff.

85
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,100
There's a bunch of stuff in the hallway.

86
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:50,340
2. We still have to clean the upstairs. There's the bathroom, the two bedrooms, and the attic.

87
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:57,240
Here we have a string of nouns. The first item is singular: bathroom.

88
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,300
So it makes sense to use a singular verb.

89
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,560
It's understood that we could use "There is/There are" constructions before each item.

90
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,920
But is sounds most natural to use "there is." There's the bathroom...

91
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:16,140
3. Are there any questions at this time?

92
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,240
"Questions" is a plural noun. We need a plural verb.

93
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:29,340
And it's a question, so it makes sense to use "any" to ask about the existence of questions.

94
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,500
4. There is no substitute for the support of a good friend.

95
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:43,940
Remember in negative statements, we could use "not" + "any" OR the word "no" + the noun.

96
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,280
There is no (what?) There is no substitute.

97
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,540
Here's a bonus task. How would you rewrite this statement to make it more concise?

98
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,060
Here's my suggestion:

99
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,020
[reads]

100
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,880
Well, there's probably more we can talk about, but we'll end here.

101
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,240
I hope you found this useful.

102
00:10:40,280 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks for watching and happy studies!
