00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:01,220
Hi!

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:05,299
I'm Vanessa, from SpeakEnglishWithVanessa.com.

3
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:08,480
Do I speak slowly?

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:15,280
Let's talk about it.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,880
I get a lot of e-mails from students telling
me, "Vanessa, I'm so glad!

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,820
I can understand everything you say.

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:29,050
But then I turn on an English TV show, and
I can't understand anything?

8
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,310
Does this mean that you're speaking slowly?"

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,750
I wanted to talk about this today because
it's a great question.

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:41,300
I want to make sure that you know exactly
the truth, and find out what's the next step.

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:47,351
First of all, when I'm explaining something,
like today, in these short videos, I want

12
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:50,240
to make sure that you can understand everything.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,560
So my pronunciation isn't unnatural.

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,560
I'm.

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,560
Not.

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,560
Talking.

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,560
Like.

18
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,560
This.

19
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,560
Very.

20
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,560
Slowly.

21
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,560
For.

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,560
Children.

23
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,920
I'm not talking like that, but I am talking
clearly, and a little bit reduced.

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,810
A little bit slower, because I want to make
sure that you can understand everything.

25
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,830
I'm also talking to a camera.

26
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:21,240
I know that you are watching, but on my side,
I see a camera, so it's a little bit difficult

27
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,960
to have a natural conversation when someone's
not there.

28
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,070
The reason why I wanted to tell you this,
is because I have a lot of videos on my YouTube

29
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,130
channel with other English-speakers.

30
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,390
There's videos with people through Skype.

31
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:42,990
There's videos with people in my house, around
my city ... I think this is a really good

32
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,920
way to take your English listening to the
next level.

33
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:55,700
Start with these videos, more slower explanations,
and then watch videos with my voice ... You

34
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,420
already understand my voice ... plus one other
person.

35
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,520
I'll make sure that in the description and
at the end of this video, I link to some of

36
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,760
those videos so that you can check them out.

37
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:15,220
Then the next step is to watch a TV show,
or another YouTube video with someone who's

38
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,510
not me.

39
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:19,850
Someone who you don't completely understand
already.

40
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:27,040
I think those are good steps, starting with
these explanation videos, then watching a

41
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,209
conversation video that I've had, and then
going to someone else.

42
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:38,430
That way, you can test your skills and grow
them step-by-step.

43
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,880
Because my goal is to prepare you for the
real world, kind of like a parent who's raising

44
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:51,350
a child and the goal is to send them out as
an adult and prepare them for the real world,

45
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:58,099
my goal for you is so that you can understand
anyone, and really communicate in any situation.

46
00:02:58,099 --> 00:02:59,910
Not just with me.

47
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:06,270
I think that this three-step plan, start with
these basic videos, then go to conversation

48
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:12,500
videos with me, and then go to conversations
with other people who have a completely different

49
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,500
style of speaking ... That's going to really
help you.

50
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,260
This is something that I integrate into the
course The Fearless Fluency Club.

51
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,959
Each month, we have a conversation with me
and another English-speaker.

52
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,280
Sometimes two other speakers.

53
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,810
That way, you can hear how this natural conversation
sounds.

54
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:37,060
It's usually pretty fast, but you already
understand my voice, so it's going to help

55
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,810
you to increase step-by-step.

56
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,960
Now, I have a question for you.

57
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:48,790
I want to know, when you study English, do
you mainly focus on English learning materials,

58
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,800
like this kind of video?

59
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:58,700
Or do you mainly focus on English TV shows
or movies, some bigger content that's meant

60
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,320
for native speakers?

61
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:06,930
I think it's good to start with more basic
content, and then move to those more challenging

62
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,580
things, but I want to know for you.

63
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:13,930
What do you mainly enjoy as you're studying
English?

64
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,970
Let us know in the comments below, and I can't
wait to see what you have to say.

65
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,600
Thanks so much, and I'll see you the next
time.

66
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,760
Bye!

67
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:27,449
The next step is to download my free e-book,

68
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:28,449
Speaker.
