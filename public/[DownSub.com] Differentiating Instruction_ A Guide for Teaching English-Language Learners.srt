1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,820
- Teaching for English language learners

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,200
is good teaching for everybody.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,910
- It is definitely about building their

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,200
literacy skills but also their confidence.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,000
I have a range of students from beginners

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,940
to high intermediate students.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,160
So I use the inductive strategy

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,850
because it can meet the needs of everyone.

9
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,580
Yes, making connections because
she said the word, remember.

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,670
This makes me remember.

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,670
- The goal is to make the lesson
accessible to all students.

12
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,066
Wanna see my picture?

13
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:38,380
(cross-talking)

14
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,161
You do like or you don't like my picture?

15
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:40,994
- [Student] I don't like.

16
00:00:40,994 --> 00:00:43,340
- Aw, that makes me feel sad.

17
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,020
Background knowledge is not just

18
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,860
what students bring to the class,

19
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,700
what they've learned previously.

20
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,190
It's also providing students
with the information

21
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,373
they need to be able to
access an upcoming lesson.

22
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,330
Also, the students in my class

23
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:05,300
actually speak three or more languages.

24
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,210
Okay, English just doesn't happen

25
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,020
to be one of them yet,
so they're learning.

26
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,863
Write it, yeah, in your lan--

27
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:15,260
in Pashto or in Farsi.

28
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,670
- Fair is not equal, you know.

29
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:22,330
And it's true, if with
differentiation too.

30
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:27,330
I mean, not everybody will
get the same exact text

31
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,160
or use the same strategy, but it's fair

32
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,120
because you're meeting every
student where they are,

33
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,890
and we're helping them
progress to the next level.

34
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,723
Okay.

35
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,280
- [Student] We don't like it.

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,280
- Sometimes I pair students
by same proficiency.

37
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,210
Other times I might choose
a more difficult text

38
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,680
but pair my beginners with a
higher proficiency student.

39
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,310
- [Student] Red tile, middle
school the worst years.

40
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:00,510
- An easy way to differentiate is

41
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,093
to have put videos at slower speeds.

42
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,870
It's not just a list of strategies that

43
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,793
comes out of within
relationships of students.

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,390
When I was first starting
Spanish, I was very scared.

45
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,290
Being a environment where
students are going to risk.

46
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,980
Where people are gonna
have a sense of humor.

47
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,400
There's 2/3, it's two, four.

48
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,270
I teach English, not math, two, four.

49
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,850
- I think of differentiation more

50
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,030
like a mindset, than on
Tuesday I differentiate.

51
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,220
You're constantly thinking how do I

52
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,973
make this accessible to everyone?

53
00:02:38,120 --> 00:00:00,000
All right, last step.
