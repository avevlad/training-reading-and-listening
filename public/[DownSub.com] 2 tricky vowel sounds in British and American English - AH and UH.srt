1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,520
Hi everyone, I’m Vicki and I’m British.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,390
And I’m Jay and I’m American and this
video is long overdue.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,389
Why is it overdue?

4
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:13,639
I’ve been slow.

5
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:20,609
A year ago, we made a video about how we both
pronounce 'can' and 'can’t' in English.

6
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,320
It was nearly two years ago.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,839
We say the negative word 'can’t' differently.

8
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:28,820
She means can’t.

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,060
Can’t.

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,310
Can’t.

11
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,520
Sometimes when Jay says it, I don’t understand
him.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,450
I don’t want you to see.

13
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,379
I can’t see.

14
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:40,750
Oh well let me try again.

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,750
Why?

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,750
I can’t see?

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,290
Do you mean you can or you can’t see.

18
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,600
I can’t see.

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,940
That video was very popular.

20
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,420
But in the comments a lot of you said you
had a problem.

21
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:02,149
Yes, a lot of people didn’t want to say
can’t the British way in case they say 'beep'.

22
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:05,630
Oh, I said a rude word.

23
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:07,330
Lots of people are worried about that.

24
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:13,490
They don’t want to sound rude
Some of you told us you say 'cannot' instead.

25
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,360
That’s clear, but it sounds strange.

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,990
Cannot is more frequent in written English.

27
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,030
We don’t say it much when we’re speaking.

28
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,710
It sounds stilted.

29
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,080
You don’t want to sound formal and strange.

30
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,899
So what we need to do is work on the vowel
sound – the AH sound.

31
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:36,350
That way you can say it confidently.

32
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:40,500
And make sure you don’t get it mixed up
with UH.

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,240
This is going to be useful for pronouncing
lots of words, and good for your listening too.

34
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,200
So where should we start?

35
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,760
I think we should look at what’s causing
the problem in the first place.

36
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,579
Too many English vowels.

37
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:07,030
We have five vowels in the English alphabet,
but we pronounce them in different ways, so

38
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,479
we have lots of vowel sounds.

39
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,180
When I was learning Japanese there were just
five vowel sounds.

40
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,940
It was pretty easy.

41
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,630
Spanish is another language that has five.

42
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:26,310
If your language has fewer vowel sounds than
English, of course it’s going to be difficult

43
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,800
to hear and say the English ones.

44
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,700
You have to train your ear and learn to move
your mouth muscles differently.

45
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,920
We have twelve pure vowel sounds in English
and we’re going to focus on two that are

46
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,270
very similar.

47
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,830
I thought it was eleven sounds.

48
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,830
Ah.

49
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:46,830
No.

50
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:51,680
In American English there are eleven, but
in British English we have twelve.

51
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
Really?

52
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,230
Yes, there’s one you don’t say.

53
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,580
What’s that?

54
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,230
o, like in the word lot.

55
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,290
We’ve made another video about that.

56
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,590
But we’re focusing on two other vowel sounds
today: AH and UH.

57
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,840
So you can say can’t and not 'beep'.

58
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,010
Ah I did it again.

59
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,060
So let’s look at these sounds.

60
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,070
AH…

61
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,620
This is the sound I make when Vicki gives
me a foot rub.

62
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,950
AH.

63
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,950
You wish.

64
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,280
And what about UH?

65
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,120
That’s when I’ve made a mistake. UH!

66
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,360
AH.

67
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,040
UH.

68
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,540
AH.

69
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,940
UH.

70
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,380
AH.

71
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,400
UH.

72
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,480
AH.

73
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,980
UH.

74
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,220
AH 
is a longer sound.

75
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,140
AH.

76
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,240
And with AH there’s a little more jaw drop.

77
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,880
AH.

78
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:58,340
And you press your tongue down a bit at the
back.

79
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,700
So when your jaw goes down your tongue goes
down too.

80
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,450
And there’s a little tension in your tongue.

81
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,480
Now the other sound, UH.

82
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,420
This is a shorter sound.

83
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,280
Your tongue is completely relaxed.

84
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
UH.

85
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,750
And your jaw is a little higher.

86
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,100
Say the sounds with us.

87
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,959
AH.

88
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,300
UH.

89
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,340
AH.

90
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,460
UH.

91
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,000
Now we need some words to practice.

92
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:35,730
This is where it gets tricky because sometimes
we use these sounds in different words.

93
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,070
It’s an American and British English difference.

94
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,080
So let’s start with a different vowel sound.

95
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,080
Aaaa.

96
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,200
Here are some words that we both say with
Aaaa.

97
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:51,540
Can, bag, sad, man, fat.

98
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,870
Can, bag, sad, man, fat.

99
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,290
So we both said the vowel sound Aaaa there.

100
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:06,120
But there are other words where Jay says Aaaa
and I say AH.

101
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,760
Can’t, aunt, past, laugh, class, after.

102
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:21,200
Can’t, aunt, past, laugh, class, after.

103
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,150
Did you hear the difference?

104
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,360
I said AH and Jay said Aaaa.

105
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,890
And then there are other words where we both
say AH.

106
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:39,030
Father, father, llama, llama, calm, calm,
bra, bra.

107
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,810
I think your vowel sound was a little longer
than mine.

108
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:43,820
Maybe.

109
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:49,340
We both said AH, but perhaps your AH was a
little shorter than mine?

110
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,100
What do you think?

111
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,820
Let’s try some more.

112
00:05:52,820 --> 00:06:01,980
Dark, dark, barn, barn, march, march, cart,
cart.

113
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,139
Our vowel sounds were the same again but our
R sounds were different.

114
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:07,139
Yeah.

115
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:14,389
I’m from just north of London in England,
and we don’t pronounce our Rs in these words.

116
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:18,830
There are parts of the UK where people do,
but most people don’t.

117
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,770
We’ve made another video about that.

118
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,770
OK.

119
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,980
Now there’s another group of words where
you say AH, but I don’t.

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:39,700
Doll, doll, fond, fond, lock, lock, hot, hot,
gosh, gosh.

121
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,200
Did you hear the difference?

122
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,770
I said AH – gosh.

123
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,770
But you didn’t.

124
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,770
No, I used the other extra vowel sound that
we have in British English.

125
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,740
The twelfth vowel sound.

126
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,430
It sounds so British!

127
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,520
It’s just what we say.

128
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,320
But let’s recap so far.

129
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:05,580
There are some words where I say AH and Jay
doesn’t, and some words where we both say

130
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,690
it, and some where Jay says it and I don’t.

131
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,690
OK.

132
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,710
But what about the other important sound.

133
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,840
We need to look at UH.

134
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
Yes.

135
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:23,320
UH is more straightforward because we both
say this sound in much the same words.

136
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:36,020
Cup, cup, hut, hut, luck, luck, love, love,
come, come, dull, dull.

137
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,340
So UH is a shorter sound and you need to keep
your tongue relaxed.

138
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,490
Let’s compare UH with AH now.

139
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,120
See if you can hear the difference.

140
00:07:47,120 --> 00:08:01,220
Cart cut, carp cup, dark duck, barn bun, calm
come.

141
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:13,910
Hot hut, lock luck, cot cut, fond fund, doll
dull.

142
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,310
If you find it hard, you’re not alone.

143
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,970
Yes, it’s tricky.

144
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:22,169
It’s about small movements of the tongue
and the jaw.

145
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:26,730
It just takes practice, but you’ll get it. Now,
do we have any sentences?

146
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,730
Yes.

147
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:33,140
I’ve got one for you to say and one for
me to say and you can try saying them with

148
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,380
us.

149
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,450
Your one has UH sounds.

150
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,450
OK.

151
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,309
'Don’t be unhappy, love.

152
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:43,659
Come to lunch with me and let’s have fun!'

153
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:48,040
OK, my one has AH sounds.

154
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,920
'I can’t meet you after class because I’ll
be in the bath.'

155
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,430
You mean the bath.

156
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,480
And that’s it for today everyone.

157
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,170
If you’ve enjoyed this video please give
it a like and share it with a friend.

158
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,950
See you all next Friday.

159
00:09:06,950 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye
Bye-bye.
