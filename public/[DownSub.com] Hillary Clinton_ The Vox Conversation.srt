1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,570
Ezra Klein: So let’s start with poverty.

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:11,110
Scholars have estimated or found that the
number of American families living in extreme

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,903
poverty, under $2 in cash income, has skyrocketed
in the last 20 years.

4
00:00:15,903 --> 00:00:19,510
You have about 1.5 million families and 3
million children.

5
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:25,890
Given how many children are now in that condition,
should we be following the model of countries

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,490
— like Sweden, Germany, and now Canada under
Trudeau — that have a universal child allowance

7
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,809
to cut or eliminate child poverty?

8
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:38,451
Hillary Clinton: Well, this is a very personal
and important issue to me — because, as

9
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:44,330
you know, I started out my work as a lawyer
for the Children’s Defense Fund.

10
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:50,200
And I have been focused on child poverty and
what we can do to alleviate it for a very

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,430
long time.

12
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:56,840
I would just slightly amend your question,
because we were making progress in the ’90s.

13
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,220
We had more people lifted out of poverty.

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:05,770
We had a 33 percent increase in the African-American
family income.

15
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:07,490
We were on the right track.

16
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:12,490
That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have been
looking at more ways to lift more kids out

17
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:20,200
of poverty, but we were on the right trajectory
— and, unfortunately, we changed direction.

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:28,259
We had policies that I think contributed greatly
to the increase in childhood poverty, starting

19
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,020
in 2001, the Great Recession being the worst
of those.

20
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:40,840
But there were also policy decisions, regulatory
changes — providing more leeway to the states,

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:49,320
so that they did not have either the requirement
or the incentive to continue lifting people,

22
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,829
particularly kids, out of poverty.

23
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:57,590
So we’ve got a big problem, and it’s a
problem that’s a reflection on our political

24
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,499
as well as our economic systems.

25
00:02:00,499 --> 00:02:07,369
And I do think we should focus on how we’re
going to support more families, and there

26
00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:09,520
are a number of inputs.

27
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,650
But trying to create more financial support
is something that we should look at.

28
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,829
I’m not ready to adopt a plan that comes
from some other country, because we have to

29
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:24,120
look to see how we would do anything in our
federal system — and how it would be workable

30
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,780
and what the cost-benefit analysis might be.

31
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:34,959
But while we’re looking at how we lift incomes
— which is the defining economic challenge

32
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,180
that we have for working, middle-class, and
poor families — we need to do much more

33
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:48,670
to provide the proven interventions in early
childhood education that help families, even

34
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,349
poor families, know more about how to better
prepare their kids.

35
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:58,499
We need to do more with nutrition — and
we’re making progress with health care thanks

36
00:02:58,499 --> 00:03:02,030
to SCHIP [the State Children’s Health Insurance
Program] and the Affordable Care Act.

37
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:07,890
So it’s not just a decision about whether
or not to increase the child tax credit or

38
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,159
some other means of providing a greater financial
safety net.

39
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,959
It’s also what we can do to really support
families.

40
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,159
And I think we have to move on both tracks.

41
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,060
EK: But to ask a big-picture question about
that policy shift: Something a lot of poverty

42
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,750
scholars argue to me is that we made a very
big change toward trying to support the working

43
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,189
poor — welfare reform was, of course, part
of that.

44
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:32,099
It went, from in the numbers I’ve seen,
from bringing a million of these families

45
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,829
out of poverty to around 300,000 in more recent
years.

46
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:39,010
But the expansion of the EITC [earned income
tax credit], other things we’ve seen — do

47
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,829
you think we do too little now to support
the poor who for, whatever reason, cannot

48
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:46,140
find or cannot keep a job?

49
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,530
HC: I do.

50
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,609
I know there’s a big debate — and it’s
an, important debate — about welfare reform.

51
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:58,719
Because when welfare reform was passed, there
was an expectation — certainly on my part,

52
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:05,319
and I think on the part of many who had supported
it — that there would be an expectation,

53
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:13,879
in fact a requirement, that states would have
to be contributing to the broadest possible

54
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,889
safety net, particularly in economic downturns.

55
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:22,500
So that we wouldn’t help the working poor,
particularly through the EITC — which I

56
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,009
think is one of the best anti-poverty programs
that we have devised — we would not be doing

57
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:30,840
it at the expense of the poor.

58
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:35,630
We would also be providing a continuing safety
net for the poor.

59
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:41,710
And that’s one of the programs that I was
referring to when I said that after 2001,

60
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:47,330
there were a lot of decisions made that basically
did not carry on what had been not just the

61
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:55,180
spirit but also the requirements in the law,
because we had set the base payment at the

62
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,210
highest possible rate and expected states
to do that.

63
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:07,599
So we are back to a serious problem of poverty,
and I think we have to do much more to target

64
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:16,389
federal programs to the poorest, where intergenerational
poverty is once again a cycle.

65
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:22,090
Congressman Jim Clyburn has a creative idea
called the 10-20-30 approach, where you woul’d

66
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:27,660
put a percentage of federal funds — 10 percent
of federal funds — in those communities

67
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,860
that are most impoverished and have been for
30 years.

68
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:43,180
So I think we’ have got to address really
systemic, generational poverty differently.

69
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,870
We still have to lift up working people, we
have to make it worth everyone’s while to

70
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:53,360
work, we have to create more good jobs, we
have to have the training pipeline there.

71
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:02,360
But we are now, unfortunately, back having
to face poverty that we thought we had a better

72
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,419
approach toward ending than it turns out — given
the change in administrations and attitudes

73
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:08,419
— that we did.

74
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:10,520
EK: Let me ask you about how to pay for that.

75
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,500
So I looked at the Treasury’s real daily
yield curve website today, as I do every morning

76
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,379
when I get out of bed.

77
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:23,250
And short-term interest rates on US government
debt are negative; they will pay us to take

78
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,250
money.

79
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,210
That is how much the market wants more US
government debt.

80
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,759
Should we be taking the markets up on this
offer of free money?

81
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:34,380
Should we be doing more short-term deficit
spending for infrastructure, for poverty,

82
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:39,560
for middle-class tax cuts — and worrying
less in the near-term about deficits?

83
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:47,860
HC: I think we have missed an opportunity
over the last eight years to make some big

84
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:55,200
bets on America — to make some investments
with, as you say, money that is as low in

85
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,110
terms of interest rates as it’s ever going
to be.

86
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:04,289
I have put forth ways of paying for all the
investments that I make, because we do have

87
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:08,819
the entitlement issues out there that we can’t
ignore.

88
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:15,060
But we are failing to make investments that
will make us richer and stronger in the future.

89
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,189
And that’s where I think our biggest gap
is.

90
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:23,039
I think it’s important that we look for
ways to pay for our investments.

91
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:31,000
But I think there can be short-term decisions
about the kind of federal dollars that are

92
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,030
available now, with a revenue stream to pay
them back in the future that would bridge

93
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:43,360
the gap if we can’t do everything we need
to do to really give the economy and job creation

94
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,389
the kind of boost that it needs.

95
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:50,389
But I’m not going to commit myself to that
because I would like first to figure out what

96
00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:56,569
we’re going to do, because I think we’ve
had a period where the gains have gone to

97
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:57,949
the wealthy.

98
00:07:57,949 --> 00:08:01,780
The Great Recession wiped out $13 trillion
in family wealth.

99
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:08,110
And a lot of people have come back roaring
— they are doing better than ever, corporate

100
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:14,199
profits are up, whereas so many Americans
are stalled or have fallen backward.

101
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,960
Real family income hasn’t moved.

102
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,190
In fact, it’s below where it was in 1999
and 2000.

103
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,810
So we do have a problem.

104
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,400
It’s a real problem.

105
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,539
Because we are a 70 percent consumption economy,
so we’ve got to get more growth going.

106
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:35,280
And the best way to do that is to invest in
these jobs, and I think we can pay for what

107
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:43,690
we need to do through raising taxes on the
wealthy and making it clear that there’s

108
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,540
a commitment to these investments if we’re
going to grow the economy, which will benefit

109
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,540
everybody.

110
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,540
EK: So that’s interesting.

111
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,540
I’ve not heard you say it that way before.

112
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:56,640
So part of the argument of doing pay-fors
in the near term is not just balancing the

113
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,960
budget or reducing the deficit but also bringing
a distributional fairness to the aftermath

114
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,960
of the recession.

115
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,960
HC: That’s right.

116
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:09,950
Last summer, I gave two economic speeches
which called for strong growth, fair growth,

117
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,200
and long-term growth.

118
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,040
And I think the three go together.

119
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:21,851
It is important that we look at how they can
converge, because I do believe we’ve got

120
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:23,260
to grow the economy.

121
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:29,620
I’m an economic growth Democrat, so I believe
that.

122
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,730
But we also have to make it fairer, and part
of the way we make it fairer is by shifting

123
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:39,930
some of the tax burden onto those who have
done really well despite all of the macro-

124
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:45,390
and microeconomic ups and downs in the global
economy and here at home.

125
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:52,760
And that’s why the Buffett Rule; that’s
why a fair share surcharge on incomes above

126
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,640
$5 million; that’s why closing the loopholes,
like the carried interest loophole.

127
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:03,950
It’s not just a symbolic effort to say,
“Hey, we gotta get rid of the gimmicks and

128
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:04,970
the games.”

129
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:10,400
It’s also to get money to do what we need
to do to lift the bottom and the middle up.

130
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,230
And it is a way of making clear that growth
and fairness have to go together.

131
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:18,710
EK: I think it’s probably an understatement
at this point to say that immigration has

132
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,480
been a big part of this year’s campaign.

133
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,330
We talk a lot about the folks who are already
here — the roughly 11 million unauthorized

134
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,860
immigrants who are already here.

135
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,480
And I know you’re supportive of comprehensive
immigration reform.

136
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,150
But in the broader question around immigration
and the economy, the economic data I’ve

137
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:42,880
seen suggests pretty straightforwardly that
immigrants are good for the US economy; particularly

138
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,650
they are as the population ages.

139
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:48,441
So do you think it’d be good for the economy
to double or triple the number of people who

140
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:49,880
could come here legally?

141
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,570
HC: I think we have to deal with first things
first.

142
00:10:54,570 --> 00:11:01,820
It is certainly the case that immigration
has been and continues to be good for our

143
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,060
economy.

144
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:10,890
Immigrants start businesses at a faster rate;
they seem to grow those businesses more successfully;

145
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:17,580
they do fill certain gaps in skills and knowledge
that are good for the overall economy.

146
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:21,910
But I think there are three big problems we
have to address.

147
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:27,620
One is just the human cost of those 11 million
undocumented immigrants.

148
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:33,450
I have met many of them — in fact, we all
have, whether we acknowledge it or not.

149
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,030
And these are hardworking people.

150
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,870
These are people who are contributing already
to the economy, whose children are in schools,

151
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:44,580
who are really absolutely committed to the
American dream.

152
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,060
The little girl I met in Las Vegas who is
living in fear that her parents are going

153
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:54,851
to be deported, with stomachaches and all
kinds of physical ailments, and she should

154
00:11:54,851 --> 00:12:00,290
be a kid and she should be enjoying school
and learning and deciding what she’s going

155
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,290
to do.

156
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:12,010
So I do think we have to be very understanding
and accepting of the human stories that are

157
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,620
behind these statistics that people like Donald
Trump throw around.

158
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:22,300
I think also, though, there’s a lot of evidence
that moving toward comprehensive immigration

159
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,350
reform with a path to citizenship would be
good for our economy.

160
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,761
We already know that undocumented workers
are putting about $12 billion into the Social

161
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:36,220
Security trust fund with no anticipation at
this point that they’ll ever get anything

162
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,220
out.

163
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,880
They’re paying payroll taxes; they’re
paying other forms of taxes — state and

164
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,800
local as well as federal.

165
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:50,320
So we do have a productive part of our economy,
and most of the analysts that I have seen

166
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,510
suggest that this idea of deporting everybody
would be a severe blow to the economy.

167
00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:00,060
That it would cost millions of jobs, that
it would depress economic growth.

168
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:06,140
There’s a moral, humanitarian kind of “American
values” argument, and there’s an economic

169
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,140
argument.

170
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:16,130
I think it would be very difficult to do anything
on immigration until we make the decision

171
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,490
that there will be comprehensive immigration
reform.

172
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:28,750
Because otherwise we are mixing up a lot of
the concerns about immigration in a way that

173
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:35,560
I think will hurt both the side of immigration
about people who fill jobs we need, particularly

174
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,510
high-value jobs, and the people who are here
living in fear that someone’s going to round

175
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,010
them up and deport them.

176
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,040
I think we have to look at all of these issues.

177
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,220
The idea of a comprehensive immigration reform
with a path to citizenship that I would envision

178
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:54,510
is one that would deal with a lot of these
concerns, not just the 11 million people here:

179
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:58,900
how we would regularize them, what kind of
steps they’d have to go through.

180
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:04,120
Because I believe they do have to meet certain
standards if they’re going to be on a path

181
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,600
to citizenship.

182
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:13,670
But I don’t want to mix that with other
kinds of changes in visas and other concerns

183
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:18,160
that particularly high-value technical companies
have.

184
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,690
In fact, I think keeping the pressure on them
helps us resolve the bigger problem, and then

185
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,520
we can look to see what else, if anything,
can and should be done.

186
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:37,230
But I would also add one of the biggest complaints
I hear around the country is how callous and

187
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:44,880
insensitive American corporations have become
to American workers who have skills that are

188
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,070
ones that should make them employable.

189
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:52,650
The many stories of people training their
replacements from some foreign country are

190
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:59,050
heartbreaking, and it is obviously a cost-cutting
measure to be able to pay people less than

191
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,030
you would pay an American worker.

192
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:09,800
I think it’s also a very unfair and sad
commentary that we don’t want to invest

193
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,400
in training American workers because that’s
just “time-consuming.”

194
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:19,420
And it’s a cost — so even if they could
do what we’re wanting them to do, it’s

195
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:26,610
just easier to get someone who will be largely
compliant because they want to stay in the

196
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,610
country.

197
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,610
And that’s just wrong.

198
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:35,580
So there’s work we have to do on all sides
of the immigration debate, and I want to see

199
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:41,370
companies have to do more to employ already
qualified Americans.

200
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:48,210
EK: Why do you think it is that it is so intuitive
to people, or so intuitive to many people,

201
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,290
that there is a zero-sum competition with
immigrants for jobs?

202
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,470
As you said, that’s not what the economic
evidence shows, but it’s powering a lot

203
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:57,610
of politics in this country.

204
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:05,480
HC: I think it’s because everybody with
six degrees of separation either knows or

205
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,950
thinks they know someone who knows somebody
who lost a job to an undocumented worker or

206
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:15,310
to a worker brought over on a visa to do their
job.

207
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:20,630
There’s just a lot of churn that suggests
this is a real problem.

208
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:27,860
Now, the argument that I have been making
is: Look, part of the reason why Americans

209
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:33,850
are agitated about immigration is because
they do believe their jobs are being taken

210
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:39,570
out from under them — and there is an unlevel
playing field — because if you are employing

211
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:44,300
undocumented workers, and no one is holding
you accountable — which we haven’t, we

212
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:52,960
haven’t enforced those laws in a very comprehensive
way — then it’s easy to undercut the market

213
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:58,430
and to say, “Hey, roofer, come down, I’m
substituting this man for you.

214
00:16:58,430 --> 00:16:59,430
Goodbye.

215
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,430
Thank you very much.

216
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,090
Here’s your last paycheck.”

217
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:09,429
Because the man they’re putting up there
will cost maybe as little as a tenth of the

218
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:12,669
price as the guy who was on the roof.

219
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:15,039
So I think it’s real.

220
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:23,169
It’s hard to argue an economic, analytics
abstraction — that, you know, really it’s

221
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:27,919
not that much job displacement; and, you know,
the overall economy is better; and they’re

222
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,110
making these investments in Social Security
trust funds — it’s really hard when you’re

223
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,299
the one who has lost the job.

224
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:40,429
When you are at Disney in Orlando and you’re
told to retrain your successors and then kicked

225
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:41,600
out the door.

226
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,230
Or when you’re on a construction site, and
all of a sudden you show up the next morning

227
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,210
and they tell you they don’t need you anymore
because they’ve picked up a bunch of folks

228
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,169
at a job corner in the neighborhood.

229
00:17:55,169 --> 00:18:02,610
So there’s enough real-world experience
that gives people the anxiety that we’re

230
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:07,300
seeing in the political environment.

231
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,240
Is it a big job displacement?

232
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
No.

233
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,669
But is it something?

234
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:12,799
Yes.

235
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:20,200
Is it something that is painful and personally
hurtful to somebody you know, maybe not you

236
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,490
but someone down the line?

237
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,490
Absolutely.

238
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:28,929
And I think it’s a mistake to just make
the economic argument.

239
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:36,130
I think it’s important that we see the undocumented
as people with real stories, with kids who

240
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:41,129
are going to school, with people working 70
to 80 hours a week to have a good life.

241
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:46,110
But it’s also important we see the other
side of the story, with people who feel doubly

242
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,460
hammered.

243
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,850
They feel hammered by global competition,
particularly from China taking their jobs,

244
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:58,929
and then they feel hammered from within by
employers who are willing to hire undocumented

245
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,419
workers and never get held accountable for
it.

246
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,200
EK: During the debates with Sen. Sanders,
you guys clashed on free college.

247
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,320
And you made the argument that you did not
want to be subsidizing the tuition of Donald

248
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,799
Trump’s children, and fair enough.

249
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:15,030
But that argument could also be made on public
elementary school, on public high school,

250
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,030
on public libraries.

251
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:21,580
So how do you think about when a policy should
be universal in nature and when it should

252
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,420
be specifically targeted at the needy?

253
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:34,450
HC: I think about that in the following way:
We have always had a mixed public-private

254
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,590
higher education system.

255
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:43,080
And although we do have private schools within
elementary and secondary education, they have

256
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:50,409
not been as big a factor as private higher
education has been.

257
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:54,799
So what we’re really talking about already
is a hybrid system.

258
00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:02,539
Because even Sen. Sanders is not talking about
subsidizing private higher education.

259
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:05,129
And I think that’s a significant difference.

260
00:20:05,129 --> 00:20:13,480
The cost of higher education has always been
an individual family responsibility aided

261
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:23,470
by scholarships, grants, work-study programs
— the whole mix of ways we enable people

262
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,659
to go to college.

263
00:20:24,659 --> 00:20:29,470
But we don’t pretend we’re going to do
anything for those who choose a private college.

264
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:34,419
Now we let the GI Bill go to either public
or private schools; we let Pell Grants go

265
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:36,309
to public or private schools.

266
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:43,299
So we do help to subsidize individuals at
private colleges or universities, but we have

267
00:20:43,299 --> 00:20:48,990
never taken the position that there is no
difference between the two of them.

268
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:54,270
Just like we have a big fight — as you know,
all the time — in federal and state legislatures

269
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,559
about: Will we subsidize private elementary
and secondary education?

270
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,889
And with very few exceptions, the answer has
been no.

271
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:09,149
That we do believe in the importance of a
public education system, so we have adopted

272
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:11,309
these approaches.

273
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:16,820
I had several concerns about Sen. Sanders’s
program.

274
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:26,029
I thought it was hard to justify claiming
it was free when it was going to have to be

275
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:32,820
paid for by state governments, by a lot of
state governments — up to a third of the

276
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,669
cost — that were not particularly well-known
for supporting higher education.

277
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:40,460
They’ve in fact been disinvesting.

278
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:46,399
And I think it’s more important that we
incentivize reinvestment in public higher

279
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:47,399
education.

280
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:53,840
So rather than holding out the promise of
free college — which wasn’t really free;

281
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,830
it was going to be paid for by state and federal
dollars — I think it’s important that

282
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:05,340
we say: We’re going to subsidize as far
as we can responsibly go, but we’re going

283
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,429
to expect states to reinvest in higher education.

284
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:15,340
And I know the arguments that have been made,
and he was an eloquent advocate for the argument

285
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,889
that it should be like Social Security.

286
00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:23,440
It never has been; it’s not how we view
it; and it would be incredibly expensive to

287
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,900
do that as he had proposed.

288
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,710
And even he relied on states which had been
disinvesting, and we need to reverse that

289
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,110
so they start investing.

290
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:38,909
So I want to go as high up the income scale
as I can to make sure that middle-class, working,

291
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:42,570
and poor families don’t have to borrow money
to go to college.

292
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:47,000
But I don’t want to add the cost of subsidizing
me, or subsidizing Donald Trump, at this point.

293
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,490
I don’t think that’s a sensible way for
us to approach this.

294
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:54,970
EK: To ask about another interesting fissure
from the primary: You often said that your

295
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:59,730
preference was that we built on Obamacare
to get to true universal coverage.

296
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,870
And I’ve read your plan around Obamacare,
and it doesn’t do that yet.

297
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:09,039
So what would be your approach for taking
that program from the roughly 90 percent covered

298
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,720
that it’s at now to 100 percent?

299
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,520
HC: Well, let’s celebrate that we’re at
90 percent coverage.

300
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:19,600
And I think that is one of the differences:
I see the glass at 90 percent full, not empty.

301
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,080
And starting over again — either by repealing
it, as the Republicans advocate, or by coming

302
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,730
up with a whole new plan.

303
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,590
So I think it’s tremendous.

304
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:34,009
There was a new Robert Wood Johnson study
that pointed out that just in the five years

305
00:23:34,009 --> 00:23:40,499
it’s been implemented, health care spending
has gone down $2.6 trillion from the projection

306
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:45,559
that it originally thought it would increase
by.

307
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:51,090
So we are really making progress, and I think
it is important to build on that progress.

308
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:56,990
We have 20 million people who are now in the
Affordable Care system.

309
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:02,820
We’ve expanded Medicaid, which I want to
see expanded in every state that hasn’t,

310
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:11,299
because I think that was an ideological rather
than economic or moral decision, and I want

311
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:13,320
us to build on the Affordable Care Act.

312
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,320
Now, how are we going to do that?

313
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:21,009
We’re going to have to be clear about the
competition that is needed to keep costs more

314
00:24:21,009 --> 00:24:23,570
reasonable.

315
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:29,710
It is going to require us to take a hard look
at premiums, copays, deductibles, and see

316
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:35,840
what we can do to limit the kind of additional
costs — particularly for prescription drugs

317
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,080
— that policyholders have under the exchanges.

318
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,840
We have got to encourage more competition.

319
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:51,559
Not just by working with the existing insurers
but really trying to open the door — more

320
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:56,340
successfully than was achieved — to other
forms of insurance.

321
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,950
The cooperative insurance plan hasn’t worked
in most places, but it’s worked in some

322
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:01,950
places.

323
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,370
What are the lessons we can learn from that?

324
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:09,490
So I’m actually very excited about this,
and I think we will get to 100 percent coverage,

325
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:15,429
and I think we will do it by building on what
people are now accepting by spending their

326
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:18,210
own dollars and by our subsidies of those.

327
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:27,020
And it is a much more acceptable, less disruptive
approach than starting over and trying to

328
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,169
impose a single-payer system — because,
remember, the vast majority of Americans are

329
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:34,950
getting their health insurance through their
employment.

330
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,970
There’s very little evidence they are unsatisfied
by it.

331
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:44,961
I certainly saw that firsthand when I was
working on this back in ’93 and ’94, and

332
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:51,869
I favor a public option so we can try to lower
the costs even further for people who have

333
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:56,820
a larger risk of bad health problems.

334
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,440
EK: Should that public option be able to link
with Medicare to bargain down prices?

335
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,730
HC: I think it’s going to be something we’ll
have to look at.

336
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:10,559
I have long been in favor of giving Medicare
the authority to bargain.

337
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,799
And I voted for it; I’ve spoken out for
it—

338
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,799
EK: You mean on prescription drugs?

339
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:15,320
HC: On prescription drugs.

340
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:21,419
And if it were to be a broader public option,
maybe there as well.

341
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:29,130
Because it is clear that we don’t have enough
bargaining power yet to deal with some of

342
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:37,369
the big cost drivers, like prescription drugs,
that are still not reacting the way we had

343
00:26:37,369 --> 00:26:38,799
hoped that they would.

344
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:42,559
In fact, there’s a lot of new gimmicks to
try to drive up the cost of prescription drugs.

345
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,369
But I’m actually optimistic.

346
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:47,490
I think we’re on the right track with the
Affordable Care Act.

347
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,830
And of course we’re going to have to make
adjustments.

348
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:56,380
We did with every other program that people
now defend and love, and we’ll have to do

349
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,389
it with the Affordable Care Act.

350
00:26:57,389 --> 00:27:01,909
EK: So we’ve talked about a number of policies
here — not so much about how to get them

351
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:02,909
done.

352
00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:07,940
What are the qualities you think you possess
that are needed for an effective presidency

353
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:11,749
that aren’t rewarded or revealed by the
campaign trail?

354
00:27:11,749 --> 00:27:16,679
HC: Well, I think a lot of governing is the
slow, hard boring of hard boards.

355
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:20,830
I don’t think there’s anything sexy, exciting,
or headline-grabbing about it.

356
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:26,330
I think it is getting up every day, building
the relationships, finding whatever sliver

357
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:32,830
of common ground you can occupy, never, ever
giving up in continuing to reach out even

358
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:38,960
to people who are sworn political partisan
adversaries.

359
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,929
I’ve seen it work.

360
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:42,369
I’ve seen it work.

361
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:46,009
And I’ve been part of seeing it and making
it work.

362
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:50,299
I really believe there’s no shortcut; there’s
no quick answer.

363
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:57,429
Now, if there’s a major national disaster,
then — like the Great Recession — you

364
00:27:57,429 --> 00:27:59,399
could get things done that you couldn’t
otherwise.

365
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:04,269
And you have to seize those moments, and I
think President Obama did that.

366
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:11,489
But I think you’ve got to try to push forward
as many different issues as you can all at

367
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:17,299
the same time, because you never know what’s
going to turn the tide.

368
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:21,789
So I just think it’s that getting up every
day and working on it.

369
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:27,590
It is not flashy, and you don’t telegraph
everything you’re doing, because that would

370
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:33,100
be breaching the relationship and the negotiation
that you may be involved in.

371
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:39,419
I certainly saw my husband do it, and he did
it with people who were trying to destroy

372
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:40,419
him.

373
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:46,210
Every single day, he’d meet with them at
night; they’d hammer out deals; they would

374
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:51,070
negotiate over very difficult things; they’d
shut the government down; he’d veto them;

375
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,070
they’d come back.

376
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,070
You just keep going.

377
00:28:53,070 --> 00:29:00,129
Because we’re dealing with a hyperpartisan
opposition who has decided their ideology

378
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:06,140
is more important than actually getting results
— either for their constituents or for their

379
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,140
country.

380
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:13,230
They really have put ideology above everything
else, and I don’t know all the reasons — I’m

381
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:18,419
going to wait for a smart political scientist
to explain it all to me — but it makes the

382
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:21,220
negotiating harder.

383
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:26,701
Back in the ’90s, after criticizing Bill
all day, Newt Gingrich would come over to

384
00:29:26,701 --> 00:29:30,590
the White House at 9 o’clock and they’d
negotiate for a couple of hours.

385
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:36,100
And certainly with the work that I did on
the Children’s Health Insurance Program

386
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:43,659
and the work I did as a senator — I worked
with people who were very much political opponents,

387
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:44,840
but we found that common ground.

388
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,399
And the same as secretary of state.

389
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,850
I had to round up, I think, 13 Republicans
to pass the New START treaty.

390
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:52,409
And you just keep working at it.

391
00:29:52,409 --> 00:29:59,119
It takes a lot of effort, but if you’re
persistent you can get things done.

392
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:04,119
EK: The background for that is a real structural
rise in partisanship and division.

393
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:08,549
Barack Obama is the most polarizing president
since we began polling; before him, it was

394
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:11,500
George Bush; before him, Bill Clinton.

395
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:16,409
Both you and Donald Trump begin as the least
favorably viewed major party nominees since

396
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:17,799
we began polling.

397
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:24,269
What do you think are the background drivers
of the higher polarization, higher bitterness,

398
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:29,049
that seems to afflict politicians of both
parties now?

399
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:32,409
HC: I think there are a number of factors.

400
00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:37,779
Again, I’m not sure I totally understand
it all.

401
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:43,700
The media environment — particularly the
social media environment — drives negativity.

402
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,289
It’s what captures eyeballs.

403
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:52,200
It’s what gets people to tune in or log
on.

404
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,660
It is just human nature.

405
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:58,850
Saying something negative about somebody,
whether it was a negative ad 30 years ago

406
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:07,399
or a negative tweet or other allegations today
— there’s just a really rich environment

407
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:13,260
for that to capture people’s minds and change
their attitudes.

408
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:19,700
There’s a lot of behavioral science that
if you attack someone endlessly — even if

409
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:25,460
none of what you say is true — the very
fact of attacking that person raises doubts

410
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:29,340
and creates a negative perspective.

411
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:37,609
As someone Exhibit A on that — since it
has been a long time that I’ve been in that

412
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:39,630
position — I get that.

413
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:40,630
I get it.

414
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:45,679
And it’s always amusing to me that when
I have a job, I have really high approval

415
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,059
ratings; when I’m actually doing the work,
I get reelected with 67 percent of the vote

416
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:52,409
running for reelection in the Senate.

417
00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:56,299
When I’m secretary of state, I have [a]
66 percent approval rating.

418
00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:05,440
And then I seek a job, I run for a job, and
all of the discredited negativity comes out

419
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,870
again, and all of these arguments and attacks
start up.

420
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:19,789
So it seems to be part of the political climate
now that is just going to have to be dealt

421
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:20,789
with.

422
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:29,399
But I am really confident that I can break
through that and I can continue to build an

423
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:31,200
electoral victory in November.

424
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,149
And then once I’m doing the job, we’ll
be back to people viewing me as the person

425
00:32:35,149 --> 00:32:38,720
doing the job instead of the person seeking
the job.

426
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,739
Look, I’m not making any special plea, because
it’s just reality.

427
00:32:43,739 --> 00:32:49,289
But every recent study has shown that if you
take all of the media and all of the Republicans

428
00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:52,950
and all of the independent expenditures, tens
of millions of dollars of negative attacks

429
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,009
have been run against me.

430
00:32:55,009 --> 00:33:00,570
And that’s just something I’ve learned
to live with, and I don’t pay a lot of attention

431
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,570
to it anymore.

432
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:02,820
EK: Do you think you get pulled along that
substream?

433
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,509
I think here of the debate when you say you
were proud of having Republicans as enemies.

434
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:12,259
Do you think part of this environment has
put you in a place of feeding it and running

435
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:13,259
more negative campaigns?

436
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:14,259
HC: Not very much.

437
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:18,570
I mean, you can go back and look at how I’ve
worked with Republicans, and I think I have

438
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:26,609
a very strong base of relationships with them
and evidence of that.

439
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:30,639
But, you know, they say terrible things about
me, much worse than anything I’ve ever said

440
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:31,639
about them.

441
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:38,489
That just seems to bea part of the political
back and forth now — to appeal to your base,

442
00:33:38,489 --> 00:33:41,399
to appeal to the ideologues who support you.

443
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:47,340
We have become so divided, and we’ve got
to try to get people back listening to each

444
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:52,859
other and trying to roll up our sleeves and
solve these problems that we face, and I think

445
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:53,859
we can do that.

446
00:33:53,859 --> 00:33:57,510
EK: I know we have to let you go, and I’ll
ask you this one final question.

447
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:01,200
What are three books that have influenced
how you think about policy that you think

448
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
everyone should read?

449
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,899
HC: Oh, my gosh, there are so many I’ve
read over the years.

450
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:08,530
I wrote one called It Takes a Village, which
I highly recommend—

451
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:11,310
EK: You can’t plug your own book.

452
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:18,870
HC: [Laughs] I think there’s a lot of wisdom
in Bob Putnam’s latest book, Our Kids.

453
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:24,820
I think there’s a really great story that
he tells about going back to the town he grew

454
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:33,730
up in outside of Cleveland, where kids of
all different backgrounds, economic family

455
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:38,150
standing, and they’re all together and everyone
was in it together.

456
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:46,320
And there was so little distinction, and there
was so much economic integration in that small

457
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,320
town.

458
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,659
Now he goes back to it, and it’s so divided.

459
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:55,999
It’s divided on income; it’s divided on
race; it’s just a very different environment.

460
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,410
And winners and losers are preordained at
a very early age.

461
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:06,390
So I think that’s a book that people should
read right now.

462
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:13,220
I think that a lot of Christopher Lasch’s
work and Alan Wolfe’s work and Habits of

463
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:21,540
the Heart — that wonderful old sociological
work that was led by Robert Bellah — are

464
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,930
also really helpful.

465
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:29,050
Because we need to be reminded of what is
unique about the American experience.

466
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:31,480
De Tocqueville saw it.

467
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:41,460
Habits of the Heart came from his writings,
and you can see how more difficult it is in

468
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:58,320
a 24/7, 360-degree media environment to find
the time to think, to breathe, to spend relaxation

469
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,420
hours getting to know people.

470
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,910
We just don’t do that.

471
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:10,320
We don’t build relationships; we don’t,
on the Republican-Democratic divide in Washington,

472
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,330
spend any time with each other — even less
than what I did when I was there, and that

473
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,160
wasn’t that long ago.

474
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:25,410
So I think looking at writings both by political
scientists and sociologists about how America

475
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:33,330
worked well and trying to sort through what
did we lose that has made it so hard for people

476
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,960
to even listen to each other.

477
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,290
And I do think — and I keep saying this,
because I believe it — I think the media

478
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:46,540
environment where people are rewarded for
being outrageous, for yelling at each other,

479
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:53,410
for saying things that are untrue without
being held accountable for it has contributed

480
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:58,070
to this attitude of divisiveness and separation.

481
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,240
And I regret that.

482
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:03,920
I think people — maybe it’s not the media’s
role to say, “Well, wait a minute, that’s

483
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,920
just not right.”

484
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,810
I mean, it was shocking when CNN fact-checked
some of Donald Trump’s sayings the other

485
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:10,890
day.

486
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:16,850
But it’s hard for the average viewer or
listener to do that himself, and there is

487
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:20,060
no guide any longer.

488
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:24,470
It’s just not easy to sort out what you’re
being told.

489
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:32,680
And if people are being addressed in their
fear — as opposed to their openness, their

490
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:40,620
tolerance, their hopefulness — it just creates
an even more hardened view about whether we

491
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,260
can work with each other or not.

492
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:49,860
And I worry about that; I worry it is undermining
our democracy.

493
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:53,980
A democracy relies on the glue of trust.

494
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:59,060
You don’t have to agree with me, but I do
have to believe, whether it’s an economic

495
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:02,560
transaction or my vote, that there’s a certain
expectation.

496
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:08,400
That, yeah, there are people who go off the
rails — everybody’s not what they pretend

497
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:16,120
to be, we all know that — but in general
there’s got to be that rock-solid belief

498
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:24,780
that this transaction between us as voters
and citizens rests on something deep and sacred.

499
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,220
And I don’t know how we get back to that.

500
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,460
EK: To ask just one more follow-up, and then
I swear I’ll let you go.

501
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,940
The invocation of trust there I think is really
interesting.

502
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,340
You bring up the media.

503
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,720
We are one of many institutions that the public,
if you look at the polling, has lost trust

504
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,050
in tremendously over the last 50 years.

505
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,050
They’ve lost trust in their politicians;
they’ve lost trust in business; they’ve

506
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,360
lost trust in the media.

507
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,842
So when you say that there are gatekeepers
who should fact-check — and at Vox we do

508
00:38:47,842 --> 00:38:53,760
a lot of fact-checking — but one issue is
that people don’t listen anymore.

509
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,670
Why do you think there’s been such a systemic
loss of trust across so many different institutions

510
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,670
all at once?

511
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,550
How do you explain that change in America?

512
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:09,690
HC: Well, because I really believe that none
of us have done what we should have done in

513
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:14,920
being really straightforward about what we
know and what we don’t know.

514
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,580
And being willing to say, “We reported that
story last week; it turns out we were wrong.”

515
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:24,700
Or, “We didn’t tell you everything you
might have needed to make a decision.”

516
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:31,490
I’ve argued with network executives for
25 years that somebody is going to really

517
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:39,430
figure out that running a news program where
you actually say, “Hey, we got that wrong,”

518
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:45,280
or, “I’m not so sure what he just said
was right, and I don’t think it is and let

519
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:51,000
me tell you why, and here’s the evidence
to that effect,” where someone is trying

520
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,840
to pull the curtain back as opposed to everyone
going back to their corners, whether it’s

521
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:00,790
ratings or whether it’s an ideological position
— that’s really what we’re about.

522
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:05,220
As opposed to, “We have a really solemn
responsibility, and we’re going to level

523
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,220
with you.

524
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:11,620
You may not like what you hear, but we’re
going to try to the best of our ability not

525
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:12,620
to get it wrong.

526
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,750
And when we do, we’re going to be the first
to tell you.”

527
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:21,740
I think politicians — look at the nonsense
that people say running for office, just ridiculous

528
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:29,340
stuff, and they get away with it because there’s
no big gong that rings; “Oh, my God, look

529
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,730
what so-and-so just said.”

530
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:39,850
But there should be some reward for trying
to get it right and for trying to correct

531
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:41,490
it when you get it wrong.

532
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:48,900
And maybe it’s too threatening — whether
you’re in politics, business, media, wherever

533
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,360
you are — maybe it’s just too threatening
to admit that.

534
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,720
I don’t know how we’re going to rebuild
the trust, because it really starts with saying,

535
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,140
“Hey, I made a mistake,” or, “I didn’t
get it right,” or, “Hey, I’ve got more

536
00:41:00,140 --> 00:00:00,000
information, and let me tell you,” and just
doing it in a very matter-of-fact way.
