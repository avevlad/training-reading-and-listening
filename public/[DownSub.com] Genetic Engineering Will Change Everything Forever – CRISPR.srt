1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,640
magine you were alive back in the 1980's,

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,860
and were told that computers would soon take over everything:

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:09,740
from shopping, to dating, and the stock market,

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:13,760
that billions of people would be connected via a kind of web,

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,900
that you would own a handheld device, orders of magnitudes more powerful than supercomputers.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,080
It would seem absurd, but then, all of it happened.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,520
Science fiction became our reality, and we don't even think about it.

8
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,100
We're at a similar point today with genetic engineering.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,100
So, let's talk about it.

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,040
Where it came from, what we're doing right now,

11
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,640
and about a recent breakthrough, that will change how we live and what we perceive as normal, forever.

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,320
Humans have been engineering life for thousands of years.

13
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:04,140
Through selective breeding, we strengthened useful traits in plants and animals.

14
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,260
We became very good at this, but never fully understood how it worked.

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,640
Until we discovered the code of life, Deoxyribonucleic Acid—DNA.

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:19,740
A complex molecule that guides the growth, development, function, and reproduction of everything alive.

17
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,100
Information is encoded in the structure of the molecule.

18
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,260
Four nucleotides are paired and make up a code that carries instructions.

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,060
Change the instructions and you change the being carrying it.

20
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,020
As soon as DNA was discovered, people tried to tinker with it.

21
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:42,520
In the 1960's, scientist bombarded plants with radiation to cause random mutations in the genetic code.

22
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,080
The idea was to get a useful plant variation by pure chance.

23
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,120
Sometimes it actually worked too.

24
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,440
In the 70's, scientists inserted DNA
snippets into bacteria, plants, and animals

25
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,660
to study and modify them for
research, medicine, agriculture, and for fun.

26
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:08,440
The earliest genetically modified animal
was born in 1974, making mice a standard tool for research, saving millions of lives.

27
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:14,620
In the 80's, we got commercial. The first patent was given for a microbe engineered to absorb oil.

28
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,320
Today we produce many chemicals by means of engineered life,

29
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,380
like life-saving clotting factors, growth hormones, and insulin.

30
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,980
All things we had to harvest from the organs of animals before that.

31
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,900
The first food modified in the lab went on sale in 1994: the Flavr Savr tomato,

32
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:38,240
a tomato given a much longer shelf life where an extra gene that suppresses the build-up of a rotting enzyme.

33
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,100
But GM food and the controversy surrounding them deserve a video of their own.

34
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,460
In the 1990's, there was also a brief
foray into human engineering.

35
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:52,740
To treat maternal infertility, babies were made that carried genetic information from 3 humans.

36
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,440
Making them the first humans ever to have 3 genetic parents.

37
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:03,920
Today there are super muscled pigs, fast-growing salmon, featherless chicken, and see-through frogs.

38
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,840
On the fun side, we made things glow in the dark.

39
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:11,000
Fluorescent zebrafish are available for
as little as ten dollars.

40
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,980
All of this is already very impressive, but until recently

41
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,400
gene editing was extremely expensive,
complicated, and took a long time to do.

42
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:26,220
This has now changed with a revolutionary new technology now entering the stage—CRISPR.

43
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,020
Overnight, the costs of engineering have shrunk by 99 %.

44
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,060
Instead of a year, it takes a few weeks to conduct experiments, and basically everybody with a lab can do it.

45
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,980
It's hard to get across how big a technical revolution CRISPR is.

46
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,280
It literally has the potential to change humanity forever.

47
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,060
Why did this sudden revolution happen and how does it work?

48
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,380
Bacteria and viruses have been fighting
since the dawn of life.

49
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,560
So-called bacteriophages or phages hunt bacteria.

50
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,480
In the ocean, phages kill 40 % of them every single day.

51
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:13,000
Phages do this by inserting their own genetic code into the bacteria and taking them over to use them as factories.

52
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,580
The bacteria tried to resist but failed most the time because their protection tools are too weak,

53
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,979
But sometimes bacteria survive an attack.

54
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,900
Only if they do so can they activate their most effective antivirus system:

55
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,460
they save a part of the virus DNA in their own genetic code in a DNA archive called CRISPR.

56
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,700
Here it's stored safely until it's needed.

57
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:46,260
When the virus attacks again, the bacterium quickly makes an RNA copy from the DNA archive and arms a secret weapon—a protein called CAS9.

58
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,860
The protein now scans the bacterium's
insides for signs of the virus invader

59
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,800
by comparing every bit of DNA it finds to the sample from the archive.

60
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,360
When it finds a 100-percent perfect match,

61
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:05,280
it's activated and cuts out the virus
DNA, making it useless, protecting the bacterium against the attack.

62
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,140
What's special is that CAS9 is very
precise, almost like a DNA surgeon.

63
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,920
The revolution began when scientists figured out that the CRISPR system is programmable.

64
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,400
You can just give it a copy of DNA you want to modify and put the system into a living cell.

65
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:28,040
If the old techniques of genetic manipulation were like a map, CRISPR is like a GPS system.

66
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,280
Aside from being precise, cheap, and easy, CRISPR offers the ability to edit live cells,

67
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,700
to switch genes on and off, and target and study particular DNA sequences.

68
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,820
It also works for every type of cell: microorganisms, plants, animals, or humans.

69
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,800
But despite the revolution CRISPR is for science, it's still just a first generation tool.

70
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,260
More precise tools are already being created and used as we speak.

71
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,860
In 2015, scientists use CRISPR to cut the HIV virus out of living cells

72
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,440
from patients in the lab, proving that it was possible.

73
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,780
Only about a year later, they carried out a larger scale project with rats

74
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,060
that had the HIV virus in basically all of their body cells.

75
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,280
By simply injecting CRISPR into the rats tails,

76
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,260
they were able to remove more than 50 %
of the virus from cells all over the body.

77
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,560
In a few decades, a CRISPR therapy
might cure HIV and other retroviruses,

78
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,280
viruses that hide inside human DNA like
Herpes could be eradicated this way.

79
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,180
CRISPR could also defeat one of our worst enemies—cancer.

80
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:44,620
Cancer occurs when cells refuse to die and keep multiplying while concealing themselves from the immune system.

81
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,500
CRISPR gives us the means to edit your immune cells and make them better cancer hunters.

82
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,420
Getting rid of cancer might eventually mean

83
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,620
getting just a couple of injections of a
few thousand of your own cells

84
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,300
that have been engineered in the lab to heal you for good.

85
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:05,480
The first clinical trial for a CRISPR cancer treatment on human patients was approved in early 2016 in the
US.

86
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,400
Not even a month later, Chinese scientists announced that they would treat lung cancer patients

87
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,620
with immune cells modified with CRISPR in August 2016.

88
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,600
Things are picking up pace quickly.

89
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,900
And then there are genetic diseases.

90
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:25,240
There are thousands of them and they range from mildly annoying to deadly or entail decades of suffering.

91
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,880
With a powerful tool like CRISPR, we may be able to end this.

92
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,100
Over 3,000 genetic diseases are caused by a single incorrect letter in your DNA.

93
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:42,840
We are already building a modified
version of CAS9 that is made to change just a single letter, fixing the disease in the cell.

94
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,480
In a decade or two, we could possibly cure thousands of diseases forever.

95
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,400
But all of these medical applications have one thing in common:

96
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,960
they are limited to the individual and die with them,

97
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,940
except if you use them on reproductive cells or very early embryos.

98
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,780
But CRISPR can and probably will be used for much more:

99
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:08,060
the creation of modified humans—designer babies—and will mean gradual,

100
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,420
but irreversible changes to the human gene pool.

101
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,700
The means to edit the genome of a human embryo already exists.

102
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Though the technology is still in its early stages, but it has already been attempted twice.

103
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:35,040
In 2015 and 2016, Chinese scientists experimented with human embryos and were partially successful on their second attempt.

104
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,219
They showed the enormous challenges we still face in gene editing embryos,

105
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,060
but also that scientists are
working on solving them.

106
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,040
This is like the computer in the 70's. There will be better computers.

107
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:52,220
Regardless of your personal take on
genetic engineering, it will affect you.

108
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,340
Modified humans could alter the genome of our entire species, because their engineered traits will be passed on to their children

109
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:03,800
and could spread over generations, slowly modifying the whole gene pool of humanity.

110
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,920
It will start slowly. The first designer babies will not be overly designed.

111
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,620
It's most likely that they will be created to eliminate a deadly genetic disease running in a family.

112
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:21,700
As the technology progresses and gets
more refined, more and more people may argue that not using genetic modification is unethical,

113
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,680
because it condemns children to preventable suffering and death and denies them the cure.

114
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,880
But as soon as the first engineered kid is born, a door is opened that can't be closed anymore.

115
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,300
Early on, vanity traits will mostly be left alone.

116
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:43,700
But as genetic modification becomes more accepted and our knowledge of our genetic code enhances, the temptation will grow.

117
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,960
If you make your offspring immune to Alzheimer, why not also give them an enhanced metabolism?

118
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,440
Why not throw in perfect eyesight?

119
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,160
How about height or muscular structure?

120
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,300
Full hair?

121
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,740
How about giving your child the gift of
extraordinary intelligence?

122
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:06,000
Huge changes are made as a result of the personal decisions of millions of individuals that accumulate.

123
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:11,660
This is a slippery slope. Modified humans could become the new standard.

124
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,680
But as engineering becomes more
normal and our knowledge improves,

125
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,440
we could solve the single biggest mortality risk factor: aging.

126
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,660
Two-thirds of the 150,000 people who died today will die of age-related causes.

127
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:30,220
Currently we think aging is caused by the accumulation of damage to our cells,

128
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,960
like DNA breaks and the systems responsible for fixing those wearing off over time.

129
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,580
But there are also genes that directly affect aging.

130
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,400
A combination of genetic engineering and other therapy could stop or slow down aging, maybe even reverse it.

131
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,980
We know from nature that there are animals immune to aging.

132
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,420
Maybe we could even borrow a few genes for ourselves.

133
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:59,280
Some scientists even think biological aging could be something that eventually just stops being a thing.

134
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,620
We would still die at some point, but instead of doing so in hospitals at age 90,

135
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,700
we might be able to spend a few thousand years with our loved ones.

136
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,820
Research into this is in its infancy,

137
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,840
and many scientists are rightly skeptical about the end of aging.

138
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,480
The challenges are enormous and maybe it is unachievable,

139
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:26,320
but it is conceivable the people alive today might be the first to profit from effective anti aging therapy.

140
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:31,980
All we might need is for someone to convince a smart billionaire to make it their next problem to solve.

141
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,320
On a bigger scale, we certainly could solve many problems by having a modified population.

142
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,140
Engineered humans might be better equipped to cope with high-energy food,

143
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,500
eliminating many diseases of civilization like obesity.

144
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:48,880
In possession of a modified immune system, with a library of potential threats,

145
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,680
we might become immune to most diseases that haunt us today.

146
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,120
Even further into the future, we could engineer humans to be equipped for extended space travel

147
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,160
and to cope with different conditions on another planets,

148
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,160
which would be extremely helpful in
keeping us alive in our hostile universe.

149
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,040
Still, a few major challenges await us: some technological, some ethical.

150
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,560
Many of you watching will feel uncomfortable and fear that we will create a world in which we will reject non-perfect humans

151
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,580
and pre-select features and qualities based on our idea of what's healthy.

152
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,860
The thing is we are already living in
this world.

153
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:37,340
Tests for dozens of genetic diseases or complications have become standard for pregnant women in much of the world.

154
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,620
Often the mere suspicion of a genetic defect can lead to the end of a pregnancy.

155
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,220
Take Down syndrome for example, one of the most common genetic defects.

156
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,360
In Europe, about 92 % of all pregnancies where it's detected are terminated.

157
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,280
The decision to terminate pregnancy is incredibly personal,

158
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,320
but it's important to acknowledge the reality that we are pre-selecting humans based on medical conditions.

159
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,540
There is also no use in pretending this will change,

160
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:11,800
so we have to act carefully and respectfully as we advance the technology and can make more and more
selections.

161
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,380
But none of this will happen soon.

162
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,680
As powerful as CRISPR is—and it is, it's not infallible yet.

163
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:26,120
Wrong edits still happen as well as unknown errors that can occur anywhere in the DNA and might go unnoticed.

164
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,420
The gene edit might achieve the desired result—disabling a disease,

165
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,720
but also might accidentally trigger unwanted changes.

166
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:39,600
We just don't know enough yet about the
complex interplay of our genes to avoid unpredictable consequences.

167
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,080
Working on accuracy and monitoring methods is a major concern as the first human trials begin.

168
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,760
And since we've discussed a possible positive future, there are darker visions too.

169
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,300
Imagine what a state like North Korea
could do if they embraced genetic engineering.

170
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,600
Could a state cement its rule forever by forcing gene editing on their subjects?

171
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,780
What would stop a totalitarian regime from engineering an army of modified super soldiers?

172
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,420
It is doable in theory.

173
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,220
Scenarios like this one are far, far off into the future, if they ever become possible at all.

174
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,280
But the basic proof of concept for genetic engineering like this already exists today.

175
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,720
The technology really is that powerful.

176
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,460
While this might be a tempting reason to ban genetic editing and related research, that would certainly be a mistake.

177
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:34,190
Banning human genetic engineering would only lead to the science wandering off

178
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,470
to a place with jurisdiction and rules
that we are uncomfortable with.

179
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:45,460
Only by participating can we make sure that further research is guided by caution, reason, oversight, and transparency.

180
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,620
Do you feel uncomfortable now?

181
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,880
Most of us have something wrong with them.

182
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,420
In the future that lies ahead of us, would we have been allowed to exist?

183
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,080
The technology is certainly a bit scary, but we have a lot to gain,

184
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,900
and genetic engineering might just be a step in the natural evolution of intelligent species in the universe.

185
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,380
We might end disease.

186
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:16,180
We could extend our life expectancy by centuries and travel to the stars.

187
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,420
There's no need to think small when it comes to this topic.

188
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:24,420
Whatever your opinion on genetic engineering, the future is approaching no matter what.

189
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,920
What has been insane science fiction is about to become our new reality,

190
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,160
a reality full of opportunities and challenges.

191
