00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,300
Today we’re going to go over my top 5 tips for learning English with movies and TV.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:11,640
Many people successfully learn English this way, and the great thing about it is that you’re learning something in

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,520
context, not isolated like in a vocabulary list.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,980
And this will really help you remember it.

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:23,460
In addition, you’re learning from a native speaker, so your pronunciation should be much more accurate

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,480
than if you're learning from a book if you do it right.

7
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,700
But learning English from movies and TV does NOT happen automatically.

8
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,720
Unless you’re using the tips I’m about to teach you, you won’t be learning as much English as you could.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,700
But if you DO make these tips part of your regular movie and TV watching habits,

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,020
you’ll have a powerful new learning tool that’s always available to you!

11
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,660
Now, this is not about relaxing and unwinding watching TV or a movie, this is about learning.

12
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,360
It’s an active experience, part of your studies.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,960
Let’s get started.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,900
 

15
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,760
Tip 1:  Work at your level.  If listening comprehension is a big challenge for you,

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,100
and you want to work on that specifically, start with a simple scene involving just a few people

17
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,000
in a quiet environment.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,960
I really like dramas because I think in general the pace of speaking is a little `slower.

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,020
HER is a great movie for this: slow pace, clear speech.

20
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,080
What’s the rush?

21
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,960
That was relatively easy to understand.

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,740
If your listening comprehension is very good and you’re just looking to pick up new vocabulary or phrases,

23
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:39,460
or you want to challenge your listening comprehension, you can do this by trying a scene in a noisy room,

24
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,120
or a scene where people are speaking with a non-standard accent.

25
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,480
It's that or we both better go do something else, pal.

26
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,040
That was likely much harder to understand.

27
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,220
So, work at a level that's right for you – one that's not so challenging that you understand almost nothing.

28
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,700
Tip 2:  Use a video player that has the right tools:

29
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:06,020
a toggle for subtitles and a way to easily skip back in the video. Both Netflix and HBO Go have these features,

30
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,720
and no they did not pay me to say this.

31
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,080
On YouTube, you can do a search on a topic that interests you,

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,640
and filter it so you’ll only see videos with a closed captioning file.

33
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,160
But the YouTube player doesn't have a way to easily jump back a few seconds like Netflix or HBO Go,

34
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,740
they have a skip back 10 seconds button

35
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:30,540
and I think if you can afford a subscription to one of those services, it’s really useful.

36
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,820
Let’s go on to tip #3 to see why.

37
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,360
Tip 3:  Use subtitles and the following method to learn.

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,820
Step 1 is to listen without the subtitles.

39
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,220
When you hear something you don’t understand, or a word you don’t know

40
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,520
(and it’s okay if that's pretty frequent), pause the player.

41
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,320
Go back 10 seconds and listen again, pause it.

42
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,020
Can you figure it out?

43
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,380
Write down as much of the sentence as you can in a notebook that you have just for this purpose.

44
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,580
Use an app if you like, but I prefer writing by hand.

45
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,380
Then, turn on the English subtitles and go 
back and listen again.

46
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,200
Listen and watch with the subtitles on.

47
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,180
Now, maybe the part you didn’t get is a brand new word that you’ve never seen or heard before.

48
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,400
Great, this is an awesome way to learn new vocabulary.

49
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,080
Write the word down, look up the definition, and write down the sentence you heard it in.

50
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,060
Even write down the show or movie and the scene.

51
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,620
Remembering this context will absolutely help you remember the word.

52
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,760
But maybe when you go back and watch with the subtitles you realize you know all those words.

53
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,300
Why didn’t you understand it?

54
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:40,140
That’s a very important question and answering it is the key to improving your listening comprehension.

55
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,400
Perhaps the phrase was said very quickly

56
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,860
and there were reductions in there that made it very hard to identify the word.

57
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,680
Or maybe a word has a pronunciation that's completely different than what you thought.

58
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,100
Write down the full sentence now and 
circle the words you didn’t understand.

59
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,120
Then use the skip back button to listen many times – five, maybe even more.

60
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,560
Something was pronounced in a way that you were not expecting.

61
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,340
Study how the native speaker pronounces it.

62
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,880
Importantly, say the phrase out loud yourself a few times,

63
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,200
imitating the native speaker as precisely as you can.

64
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Write down the correct pronunciation in your notebook.

65
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:23,140
Maybe even take it a step further:  Go to Youglish.com and type the word or phrase you didn’t understand.

66
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,160
Hear lots of other examples of native speakers using that word or phrase, and pay attention.

67
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,420
Is it reduced?

68
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,400
Why was it so hard for you to understand the first time?

69
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,640
This kind of work will really pay off.

70
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,660
Youglish is a search engine for YouTube videos with English subtitles and you can filter it to American English,

71
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,500
and skip from clip to clip.

72
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,380
You can also move forward or backward within a clip to get the full context.

73
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,820
It's a great way to supplement your learning.

74
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:52,400
Just like in the movies, I did a quick costume change.

75
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,080
I bet that a lot of what gets in the way of your listening comprehension is reductions and linking.

76
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,660
I have playlists for both of those topics –

77
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,600
click here or in the video description to see those playlists.

78
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,440
They’ll definitely uncover some of the mystery of listening comprehension.

79
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:17,820
Tip 4:  Review it!  If you’ve taken the time to do the work of watching, pausing, writing down sentences,

80
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:24,460
vocab words, and the context you learned them in, then do yourself a favor and solidify that learning.

81
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:29,400
Keep your English in Movies notebook close by so if you have a bit of extra time,

82
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,220
waiting for an appointment, or on your commute, or during your lunch break,

83
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,460
you can remind yourself what you learned yesterday.

84
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,480
If you learned a new vocabulary word, try to come up with your own sentences for it now.

85
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:46,340
Practice speaking your new words and phrases out loud whenever possible.

86
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,440
And Tip 5:  Set manageable goals for yourself.

87
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,180
Don’t try to learn 100 new words or phrases a day.

88
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,680
That’s too many.

89
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,540
Make it your goal to really really learn 5 or 6.

90
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:03,140
When you learn them in context and review them for seven days, that will get you good results.

91
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:09,660
Trying to learn too many too often means very little being remembered and leads to burnout.

92
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:16,100
This method I’ve given you is time-consuming, but it is concrete and you will really learn this way.

93
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:22,820
If you’ve gotten 5 or 10 good word or phrases in the first few minutes of a show or movie, reward yourself!

94
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,360
Close your notebook and watch the rest 
for enjoyment and pleasure.

95
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,300
There is a wealth of TV shows and movies that you can use to help you learn English and speak like a native.

96
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,920
What’s your favorite movie or show to use 
to study English with?

97
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,600
Let me know in the comments –

98
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,000
that will give ideas to everyone else.

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,880
And let me know which of these 5 tips was most powerful for you!

100
00:06:45,880 --> 00:00:00,000
That’s it, and thanks so much for using Rachel’s English.
