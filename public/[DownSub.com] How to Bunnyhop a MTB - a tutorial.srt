00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:09,660
In mountain biking, the act of hopping one’s
bike is called a bunnyhop.

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,670
The particular technique shown here is known
is an American bunnyhop, but to me hopping

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,690
is hopping.

4
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,760
Learning to hop or learning to hop higher
may be one of your priorities.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,119
It allows you to more easily get over obstacles,
change the orientation of your bike, go higher

6
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:29,519
on jumps, and most importantly have more fun.

7
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:36,989
So today we’ll revisit the bunnyhop with
a fresh explanation.

8
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,850
First of all, your bike doesn’t matter much.

9
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,739
Full suspension, full rigid, hardtail, flat
pedals, clipless pedals, they’re all fine.

10
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:50,090
I’ve done my highest hops on on hardtails
with flat pedals, but as you can see Brian

11
00:00:50,090 --> 00:01:01,079
is doing it clipped in on a full squish.

12
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,410
This is me last summer, bunnyhopping a 60
pound Walmart bike with water in the tires.

13
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:11,049
So as far as learning goes, any mountain bike
is just fine.

14
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:14,950
No matter what bike you have, go ahead and
drop your seat as low as it can go.

15
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,150
This will give you more room to maneuver your
bike while learning.

16
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:25,390
To bunnyhop, you need to jump yourself into
the air and take your bike with you.

17
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,610
You weigh a lot more than your bike, so think
of it as a passenger.

18
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,430
So if you can’t do this, then it’s going
to be even harder while holding your bike.

19
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,469
Make sense?

20
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:38,479
Now on to the technique.

21
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,899
The first step is to practice getting into
the meerkat position.

22
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,920
That is, standing straight up with your bars
at your waist.

23
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,229
For starters you can just try getting your
front wheel off the ground.

24
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:55,590
A lot of people have trouble with this part
in particular, and it usually comes down to

25
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,490
the preload.

26
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,679
By this, I mean forcing your weight downwards
before you pop up.

27
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:09,758
If your bike has suspension it’ll compress,
and you should pop back up in sync with it.

28
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,220
And remember, it’s you that’s popping
up and your bike that’s coming along with

29
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,250
you.

30
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,710
Don’t do this.

31
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:23,360
Do this.

32
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,130
Once you get the hang of that, you can go
full meerkat by snapping your bars to your

33
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:32,750
waist.

34
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,450
Okay so preload, meerkat position, what now?

35
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,440
Well, now all you have to do is lunge forwards.

36
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,780
It’s really that simple.

37
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,200
Of course this will only get you so high,
but you now have the tools to go higher.

38
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,350
While going meerkat you should be jumping
straight upwards.

39
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,000
See?

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,160
Jump up, snap your bars to your waist, and
continue to jump upwards.

41
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,300
If you do it with enough force, your bike
can come along for the ride.

42
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:08,390
Don’t worry about your pedals, don’t worry
about what kind of bike you have, just meerkat.

43
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:13,090
Learning to bunny hop takes practice, and
then you need to learn to time it.

44
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,910
As you approach an obstacle you need to know
when to start pulling up so you won’t case

45
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:17,910
it.

46
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,090
I recommend practicing with some sticks or
branches to keep the stakes low.

47
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,950
After a while, you’ll get it.

48
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,840
I hope you found this tutorial helpful, or
at least entertaining.
